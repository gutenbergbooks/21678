		<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

		<p>Brazil is the land of the giant among all
		the rivers of the world. It is the land of
		giant fruits and giant flowers. Of course
		it is the land of giant stories too.</p>

		<p>Years ago when the Portuguese settlers
		came to Brazil they brought with them the
		folk-tales of the old world. Just as European
		grass seed, when planted in our
		Brazilian gardens, soon sends forth such a
		rank, luxuriant growth that one hardly recognizes
		it as grass, so the old Portuguese
		tales, planted in Brazilian soil, have grown
		into new forms.</p>

		<p>The author gratefully acknowledges her
		indebtedness to the Brazilian story tellers
		to whose tales she has listened, and to the
		collection of Dr. Sylvio Romero, &#8220;Contos
		Populares do Brazil,&#8221; from which some of
		the &#8220;giant tales&#8221; have been adapted.</p>

			THE PRINCESS OF THE SPRINGS</h2>

		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Once</span>, long ago, the Moon Giant
		wooed the beautiful giantess who
		dwells in the Great River and
		won her love. He built for her a wonderful
		palace where the Great River runs into the
		sea. It was made of mother-of-pearl with
		rich carvings, and gold and silver and
		precious stones were used to adorn it.
		Never before in all the world had a giant or
		giantess possessed such a magnificent home.</p>

		<p>When the baby daughter of the Moon
		Giant and the Giantess of the Great River
		<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"></a>was born it was decreed among the giants
		that she should be the Princess of all the
		Springs and should rule over all the rivers
		and lakes. The light of her eyes was like
		the moonbeams, and her smile was like
		moonlight on still waters. Her strength
		was as the strength of the Great River, and
		the fleetness of her foot was as the swiftness
		of the Great River.</p>

		<p>As the beautiful Spring Princess grew
		older many suitors came to sing her praises
		beneath the palace windows, but she favoured
		none of them. She was so happy
		living in her own lovely palace with her own
		dear mother that she did not care at all for
		any suitor. No other daughter ever loved
		her mother as the Spring Princess loved the
		Giantess of the Great River.</p>

		<p>At last the Sun Giant came to woo the
		Spring Princess. The strength of the Sun
		<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"></a>Giant was as the strength of ten of the
		other suitors of the fair princess. He was
		so powerful that he won her heart.</p>

		<p>When he asked her to marry him, however,
		and go with him to his own palace, the
		Spring Princess shook her lovely head. &#8220;O
		Sun Giant, you are so wonderful and so
		powerful that I love you as I never before
		have loved a suitor who sang beneath my
		palace window,&#8221; said she, &#8220;but I love my
		mother, too. I cannot go away with you
		and leave my own dear mother. It would
		break my heart.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Sun Giant told the Spring Princess
		again and again of his great love for her, of
		his magnificent palace which would be her
		new home, of the happy life which awaited
		her as queen of the palace. At length she
		listened to his pleadings and decided that
		she could leave home and live with him for
		<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"></a>nine months of the year. For three months
		of every year, however, she would have to
		return to the wonderful palace of mother-of-pearl
		where the Great River runs into the
		sea and spend the time with her mother, the
		Giantess of the Great River.</p>

		<p>The Sun Giant at last sorrowfully consented
		to this arrangement and the wedding
		feast was held. It lasted for seven days and
		seven nights. Then the Spring Princess
		went away with the Sun Giant to his own
		home.</p>

		<p>Every year the Spring Princess went to
		visit her mother for three months according
		to the agreement. For three months of every
		year she lived in the palace of mother-of-pearl
		where the Great River runs into the
		sea. For three months of every year the
		rivers sang once more as they rushed along
		their way. For three months the lakes
		<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"></a>sparkled in the bright sunlight as their hearts
		once more were brimful of joy.</p>

		<p>When at last the little son of the Spring
		Princess was born she wanted to take him
		with her when she went to visit her mother.
		The Sun Giant, however, did not approve
		of such a plan. He firmly refused to allow
		the child to leave home. After much pleading,
		all in vain, the Spring Princess set out
		upon her journey alone, with sorrow in her
		heart. She left her baby son with the best
		nurses she could procure.</p>

		<p>Now it happened that the Giantess of the
		Great River had not expected that her
		daughter would be able to visit her that year.
		She had thought that all the rivers and lakes,
		the palace of mother-of-pearl, and her own
		mother heart would have to get along as best
		they could without a visit from the Spring
		Princess. The Giantess of the Great River
		<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"></a>had gone away to water the earth. One of
		the land giants had taken her prisoner and
		would not let her escape.</p>

		<p>When the Spring Princess arrived at the
		beautiful palace of mother-of-pearl and gold
		and silver and precious stones, where the
		Great River runs into the sea, there was no
		one at home. She ran from room to room
		in the palace calling out, &#8220;O dear mother,
		Giantess of the Great River, dear, dear
		mother! Where are you? Where have
		you hidden yourself?&#8221;</p>

		<p>There was no answer. Her own voice
		echoed back to her through the beautiful
		halls of mother-of-pearl with their rich carvings.
		The palace was entirely deserted.</p>

		<p>She ran outside the palace and called to
		the fishes of the river, &#8220;O fishes of the river,
		have you seen my own dear mother?&#8221;</p>

		<p>She called to the sands of the sea, &#8220;O
		<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"></a>sands of the sea, have you seen my darling
		mother?&#8221;</p>

		<p>She called to the shells of the shore, &#8220;O
		shells of the shore, have you seen my precious
		mother?&#8221;</p>

		<p>There was no answer. No one knew
		what had become of the Giantess of the
		Great River.</p>

		<p>The Spring Princess was so worried that
		she thought her heart would break in its
		anguish. In her distress she ran over all
		the earth.</p>

		<p>Then she went to the house of the Great
		Wind. The Giant of the Great Wind was
		away, but his old father was at home. He
		was very sorry for the Spring Princess when
		he heard her sad story. &#8220;I am sure my son
		can help you find your mother,&#8221; he said as
		he comforted her. &#8220;He will soon get home
		from his day&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"></a>When the Giant of the Great Wind
		reached home he was in a terrible temper.
		He stormed and raged and gave harsh blows
		to everything he met. His father had hid
		the Spring Princess in a closet out of the
		way, and it was fortunate indeed for her
		that he had done so.</p>

		<p>After the Great Wind Giant had taken
		his bath and eaten his dinner he was better
		natured. Then his father said to him, &#8220;O
		my son, if a wandering princess had come
		this way on purpose to ask you a question,
		what would you do to her?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;d answer her question as best I
		could, of course,&#8221; responded the Giant of
		the Great Wind.</p>

		<p>His father straightway opened the closet
		door and the Spring Princess stepped out.
		In spite of her long wanderings and great
		<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"></a>anguish of mind she was still very lovely as
		she knelt before the Giant of the Great Wind
		in her soft silvery green garments embroidered
		with pearls and diamonds. The big
		heart of the Giant of the Great Wind was
		touched at her beauty and at her grief.</p>

		<p>&#8220;O Giant of the Great Wind,&#8221; said the
		Spring Princess, as he gently raised her from
		her knees before him, &#8220;I am the daughter of
		the Giantess of the Great River. I have
		lost my mother. I have searched for her
		through all the earth and now I have come
		to you for help. Can you tell me anything
		about where she is and how I can find her?&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Giant of the Great Wind put on his
		thinking cap. He thought hard. &#8220;Your
		mother is in the power of a land giant who
		has imprisoned her,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I happen to
		know all about the affair. I passed that way
		<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"></a>only yesterday. I&#8217;ll gladly go with you
		and help you get her home. We&#8217;ll start at
		once.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Giant of the Great Wind took the
		Spring Princess back to earth on his swift
		horses. Then he stormed the castle of the
		land giant who had imprisoned the Giantess
		of the Great River. The Spring Princess
		dug quietly beneath the castle walls to the
		dungeon where her mother was confined.
		You may be sure that her mother was overjoyed
		to see her.</p>

		<p>When the Spring Princess had led her
		mother safely outside the castle walls she
		thanked the Giant of the Great Wind for
		all he had done to help her. Then the
		Giantess of the Great River and the Spring
		Princess hastened back to the wonderful palace
		of mother-of-pearl set with gold and silver
		and precious stones, where the Great
		<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"></a>River runs into the Sea. As soon as she had
		safely reached there once more the Spring
		Princess suddenly remembered that she had
		stayed away from her home in the palace of
		the Sun Giant longer than the three months
		she was supposed to stay according to the
		agreement. She at once said good-bye to
		her mother and hastened to the home of the
		Sun Giant, her husband, and to her baby
		son.</p>

		<p>Now the Sun Giant had been very much
		worried at first when the three months had
		passed and the Spring Princess had not come
		back to him and her little son. Then he became
		angry. He became so angry that he
		married another princess. The new wife
		discharged the nurses who were taking care
		of the tiny son of the Spring Princess and
		put him in the kitchen just as if he had been
		a little black slave baby.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"></a>When the Spring Princess arrived at the
		palace of the Sun Giant the very first person
		she saw was her own little son, so dirty
		and neglected that she hardly recognized
		him. Then she found out all that had happened
		in her absence.</p>

		<p>The Spring Princess quickly seized her
		child and clasped him tight in her arms.
		Then she fled to the depths of the sea, and
		wept, and wept, and wept. The waters of
		the sea rose so high that they reached even to
		the palace of the Sun Giant. They covered
		the palace, and the Sun Giant, his new wife,
		and all the court entirely disappeared from
		view. For forty days the face of the Sun
		Giant was not seen upon the earth.</p>

		<p>The little son of the Spring Princess grew
		up to be the Giant of the Rain. In the
		rainy season and the season of thunder showers
		<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"></a>he rules upon the earth. He sends upon
		the earth such tears as the Spring Princess
		shed in the depths of the seas.</p>

			THE FOUNTAIN OF GIANT LAND</h2>

		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Long</span> ago there lived a king who
		was blind. He had employed all
		the wise physicians in the kingdom,
		but all to no avail. Not one of them did a
		single thing to restore his lost eyesight.</p>

		<p>One day a little old woman came to the
		door of the palace begging alms. She said
		to the servant at the door, &#8220;I wish to say a
		word to the king who is blind. I know a
		sure cure for his blindness.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The servant led the little old woman into
		the king&#8217;s presence. He was sitting upon
		the royal throne with his royal crown upon
		his head, but his blind eyes were bandaged
		<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"></a>and his royal face was sad because he could
		no longer see the bright sunlight shining
		upon the deep blue sea from the window of
		the palace, nor the lords and ladies of the
		court before him in their gorgeous garments
		of purple and cloth of silver and cloth of
		gold, nor of the face of the queen.</p>

		<p>&#8220;O royal majesty,&#8221; said the little old
		woman as she bowed low before him, &#8220;there
		is only one thing in the whole world which
		will restore your lost eyesight. It is the
		water of the fountain of Giantland. Bathe
		your eyes in that water and your lost eyesight
		will be restored at once.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;How can I obtain this wonderful
		water?&#8221; asked the king. &#8220;Giantland is a
		long distance from my kingdom and I do
		not know the way there.&#8221; The king, the
		queen, and all the courtiers held their breaths
		to listen to the reply of the little old woman.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"></a>&#8220;Your Majesty will need to build a strong
		fleet to sail up the great river which leads
		to Giantland,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The expedition
		will need as its leader a prince with a brave
		heart, for there will be many perils on the
		way to test his mettle. The fountain of
		Giantland is at the summit of a long steep
		rocky mountain, and it can be reached only
		by a prince who ascends the mountain looking
		neither to the right nor to the left. All
		along the way stand huge giants ready to
		enslave one the moment he stops looking
		straight ahead. If one should succeed in
		climbing the mountain the fountain is there
		at the summit, but it is guarded by a dragon.
		One can approach it only when the dragon
		is asleep. Many princes have tried this
		quest and all have failed. If you should be
		able to send a prince brave enough and wise
		enough to succeed, there at the top of the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"></a>mountain he will find a little old woman
		who will tell him whether or not the dragon
		is asleep.&#8221;</p>

		<p>With these words the little old woman
		withdrew from the royal presence. The
		king pondered over her advice. Then he
		sent for the three princes and told them the
		story.</p>

		<p>&#8220;O my father, I am brave and wise,&#8221; said
		the eldest prince as soon as he had heard his
		father&#8217;s words. &#8220;I will go upon this quest.
		I will bring you a bottle of the water of the
		fountain of Giantland that your sight may
		be restored.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The king ordered a great fleet to be prepared
		to sail up the river to Giantland. He
		collected an enormous sum of money to provide
		for the prince. The whole kingdom
		buzzed with preparation for the journey.</p>

		<p>The prince planted an orange tree in the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"></a>palace garden and said to his younger
		brother, &#8220;Keep close watch of this tree. If
		its leaves begin to wither you will know that
		some evil has befallen me. Come to my
		aid.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The eldest prince set out with a great
		fleet and his pockets lined with gold. He
		anchored in many harbors along the way.
		The prince was very fond of gaming and
		there were many opportunities to play. Before
		he had reached Giantland he had lost
		the golden linings from his pockets.</p>

		<p>After the prince had sailed up the great
		river which leads to Giantland he saw the
		steep rocky mountain towering before him.
		He set a bottle for the water of the fountain
		of Giantland carefully upon his head and
		slowly ascended the steep path. He kept
		his eyes fixed straight ahead.</p>

		<p>Soon, however, he heard giant voices
		<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"></a>shouting at him. From the corners of his
		eyes he could see giant forms along the pathway.
		He forgot that he must look neither to
		the right nor to the left.</p>

		<p>The moment the prince turned his eyes a
		giant immediately seized him and made him
		his slave. &#8220;You shall be my slave for ever
		and a day,&#8221; said the giant, &#8220;unless you have
		gold enough in your pockets to pay your ransom.&#8221;
		The prince had no gold.</p>

		<p>At home in the palace garden the leaves
		of the orange tree which the eldest prince
		had planted began to wither. His younger
		brother noticed it at once and went to the
		king. &#8220;O my father,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I know that
		my brother has fallen into trouble. I must
		go to his aid.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The king at once prepared another great
		fleet. He provided the prince with even
		more gold than his brother had taken with
		<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"></a>him. Every one in the whole kingdom did
		his best to hasten the preparations.</p>

		<p>In the palace garden the prince planted
		a lemon tree and called the youngest prince
		into the garden. The youngest prince was
		playing with his dogs. He was a mere boy.
		&#8220;Keep close watch of this lemon tree while
		I am away,&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;If its leaves
		begin to wither you will know that I am in
		trouble. Come to my aid.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The prince sailed up the great river which
		leads to Giantland. He anchored at many
		harbors and took part in many <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">festas</em>. By
		the time he had reached Giantland he had
		spent all his gold.</p>

		<p>At home in the palace garden the youngest
		prince watched the lemon tree carefully
		every day. He watered it and pruned it.
		He took splendid care of it.</p>

		</div>

		<p>When at last the prince set out to climb
		<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"></a>the mountain which leads to the fountain of
		Giantland he felt very brave and very wise.
		He climbed steadily on and on, looking
		neither to the right nor to the left, even
		though he heard the voices of the giants
		shouting at him, and from the corners of his
		eyes could see the giant forms along the pathway.</p>

		<p>Suddenly he heard the voice of his own
		brother, the eldest prince, weeping as the
		giant gave him blows. At that sound he forgot
		all about looking straight ahead.</p>

		<p>The moment the prince turned his eyes
		from the pathway straight ahead of him a
		giant seized him and made him his slave.
		&#8220;You shall be my slave for ever and a day,&#8221;
		said the giant, &#8220;unless you have gold enough
		to pay your ransom.&#8221;</p>

		<p>At home in the palace garden his little
		brother was watching the lemon tree. The
		<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"></a>very moment its leaves began to wither he
		noticed it and ran at once to the king. &#8220;O
		my father,&#8221; he cried as soon as he was in the
		king&#8217;s presence. &#8220;My brother is in trouble.
		I must go to his aid.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;You, my son, are only a lad,&#8221; said the
		king. &#8220;How can you succeed when your
		two older brothers have failed? I cannot
		bear to let you go. You are all I have left.
		I prefer to remain blind the rest of my
		days. O, why did I ever listen to the story
		the little old woman told me about the water
		of the fountain of Giantland?&#8221;</p>

		<p>The youngest prince begged so hard to go
		that at length his father granted his request
		and prepared a fleet for him. He gave him
		all the gold he could collect in the kingdom.</p>

		<p>The prince set out with brave heart. He
		sailed on his way steadily although at every
		harbour there were voices which bade him
		<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"></a>linger. There were games and feasting and
		fair maidens.</p>

		<p>Soon the youngest prince had reached
		Giantland. Above him rose the rough steep
		rocky mountain. Before he started to make
		the ascent he first stuffed cotton in his ears.
		Then he carefully placed upon his head a
		bottle to fill with the water of the fountain
		of Giantland.</p>

		<p>He climbed up the steep mountain looking
		neither to the right nor to the left.
		Through the cotton in his ears he could
		faintly hear the giant voices calling him.
		From the corners of his eyes he could see
		the giant forms along the pathway. He
		resolutely kept his eyes fixed straight ahead
		and steadily climbed upward though the
		path was very rough and full of stones.
		The cotton in his ears prevented him from
		hearing the voices of his two brothers
		<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"></a>crying out when the giants beat them.</p>

		<p>At length the lad was in sight of the fountain
		at the summit of the mountain. The
		little old woman was standing in the path,
		watching his ascent. As soon as he came
		near to her he took the cotton out of his ears
		so that he might hear what she had to say to
		him.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You have arrived at a safe moment,&#8221;
		the little old woman told him. &#8220;The
		dragon is asleep.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The little old woman helped the prince
		fill the bottle with water from the fountain.
		Then she said, &#8220;The dragon which guards
		the fountain is an enchanted princess. No
		prince has ever before been brave enough
		and wise enough to reach this spot. In a
		year and a day from this moment her enchantment
		will be broken. Come again and
		claim her as your bride.&#8221;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"></a>The little old woman gave the prince a
		ring, and the prince drew a ring from his
		own finger and gave it to the little old
		woman. &#8220;When the enchantment is broken
		put my ring upon the finger of the princess,&#8221;
		he said. &#8220;Expect me back in a year and a
		day. I&#8217;ll be sure to come.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The prince made his way back down the
		steep slope of the mountain, guarding his
		bottle full of the water of the fountain of
		Giantland with the utmost care. When he
		was half way down the mountain he saw his
		two brothers standing in his path.</p>

		<p>&#8220;<em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Viva</em>,&#8221; cried they. &#8220;You have been
		successful. You have a bottle full of the
		water from the fountain. Now if you also
		have your pockets full of gold you can pay
		our ransom and we will return with you to
		our father&#8217;s kingdom.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;My pockets are still lined with gold
		<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"></a>which my father gave me,&#8221; said the youngest
		prince. &#8220;Help yourselves. It is yours
		if it can serve you.&#8221; There was more than
		enough money to pay the ransom of his two
		older brothers.</p>

		<p>When they were sailing down the great
		river towards home the two older brothers
		plotted against the youngest prince.
		&#8220;Come,&#8221; said one to the other. &#8220;How can
		we let our father know that it was our little
		brother who succeeded in this quest? Let
		us cast our brother ashore. Then we will
		go together to our father with the water from
		the fountain of Giantland. When his sight
		is restored we will share his blessing and the
		honors of the kingdom. We will claim no
		knowledge of our youngest brother.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is what the two eldest princes did.
		The youngest prince was cast ashore when
		he was asleep. After many long weary wanderings
		<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"></a>he found refuge in the hut of a poor
		fisherman and hired out to work for him.</p>

		<p>The king&#8217;s eyesight was restored immediately
		when he had bathed his eyes in the
		water from the fountain of Giantland.
		The two princes were given all the honors
		of the kingdom. The whole kingdom, however,
		mourned the loss of the little prince.
		The king and queen never gave up hoping
		that he would come back to them. The
		queen carefully laid away all the clothes
		which had belonged to the youngest prince
		so that they would be ready for him if he
		should return to the palace. Every day she
		shook them out with loving care, so that the
		<em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">baratas</em> and white ants would not eat holes in
		them.</p>

		<p>A year and a day flew swiftly by. The
		huge dragon which had guarded the fountain
		of Giantland escaped from her enchantment
		<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"></a>and was restored to the form of a beautiful
		princess.</p>

		<p>The little old woman and the princess
		watched and waited for the return of the
		prince according to his promise. &#8220;Some evil
		must surely have befallen the lad,&#8221; said the
		little old woman. &#8220;Let us go in search of
		him. I know he was a lad who would not
		break his word.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The little old woman and the beautiful
		princess who wore the prince&#8217;s own ring
		upon her finger came to the palace of the
		king. When the king had listened to the
		story they told, the guilty princes were called
		before him. They were forced to confess
		their evil deed. They were immediately
		thrown into prison. The anger of the whole
		kingdom was kindled against them.</p>

		<p>Then the king and the queen and all the
		court sailed in their swiftest ships to the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"></a>place where the little prince had been cast
		ashore. The little old woman and the beautiful
		princess who wore the prince&#8217;s own ring
		upon her finger went with them. At length
		after much searching they found the fisherman&#8217;s
		hut and the prince working for the
		fisherman.</p>

		<p>The king and the queen and all the court
		wept tears of joy when they beheld the
		youngest prince alive and well. The queen
		wept again when she noticed the poor rough
		clothing which the prince was wearing. She
		had brought with her the prince&#8217;s favourite
		suit of cloth of gold which she had laid away
		carefully. When the prince put it on it was
		a trifle tight and a little bit too short for
		him, as he had grown so much in the year.
		Nevertheless he looked very handsome in it
		when he stood before the beautiful princess
		and claimed her as his bride.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35"></a>The fisherman was greatly astonished at
		all the proceedings, for he had never dreamed
		that it was the king&#8217;s son who had been working
		for him all the year and sleeping on a
		mat at his side on the floor of his rude hut.</p>

		<p>&#8220;He may be a prince, but he is the most
		faithful lad who ever worked for me,&#8221; said
		the fisherman.</p>

		<p>&#8220;He is indeed a prince,&#8221; cried the courtiers,
		&#8220;and the bravest, most faithful prince
		which any land in all the world ever boasted
		of.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;His princely deeds have proven to all the
		world that he is fit to reign as king over our
		fair land when I no longer live,&#8221; said the
		king as he gave the prince and the beautiful
		princess his royal blessing.</p>

			THE BOY AND THE VIOLIN</h2>

		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Once</span> upon a time there was a man
		who had an only son. When the
		man died the son was left all alone
		in the world. There was not very much
		property&#8212;just a cat and a dog, a small
		piece of land, and a few orange trees. The
		boy gave the dog away to a neighbour and
		sold the land and the orange trees. Every
		bit of money he obtained from the sale he invested
		in a violin. He had longed for a
		violin all his life and now he wanted one
		more than ever. While his father had lived
		he could tell his thoughts to his father, but
		now there was none to tell them to except
		<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"></a>the violin. What his violin said back to
		him made the very sweetest music in the
		world.</p>

		<p>The boy went to hire out as shepherd to
		care for the sheep of the king, but he was
		told that the king already had plenty of
		shepherds and had no need of another. The
		boy took his violin which he had brought
		with him and hid himself in the deep forest.
		There he made sweet music with the violin.
		The shepherds who were near by guarding
		the king&#8217;s sheep heard the sweet strains, but
		they could not find out who was playing.
		The sheep, too, heard the music. Several
		of them left the flock and followed the sound
		of the music into the forest. They followed
		it until they reached the boy and the cat and
		the violin.</p>

		<p>The shepherds were greatly disturbed
		when they found out how their sheep were
		<a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"></a>straying away into the forest. They went
		after them to bring them back, but they could
		find no trace of them. Sometimes it would
		seem that they were quite near to the place
		from which the music came, but when they
		hurried in that direction they would hear
		the strains of music coming from a distant
		point in the opposite direction. They were
		afraid of getting lost themselves so they
		gave up in despair.</p>

		<p>When the boy saw how the sheep came to
		hear his music he was very happy. His
		music was no longer the sad sweet sound it
		had been when he was lonely. It became
		gayer and gayer. After a while it became
		so gay that the cat began to dance. When
		the sheep saw the cat dancing they began to
		dance, too.</p>

		<p>Soon a company of monkeys passed that
		way and heard the sound of the music.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"></a>They began dancing immediately. They
		made such a chattering that they almost
		drowned the music. The boy threatened to
		stop playing if they could not be happy without
		being so noisy. After that the monkeys
		chattered less.</p>

		<p>After a while a tapir heard the jolly sound.
		Immediately his threetoed hind feet and
		fourtoed front feet began to dance. He
		just couldn&#8217;t keep them from dancing; so he,
		too, joined the procession of boy, cat, sheep,
		and monkeys.</p>

		<p>Next the armadillo heard the music. In
		spite of his heavy armour he had to dance
		too. Then a herd of small deer joined the
		company. Then the anteater danced along
		with them. The wild cat and the tiger
		came, too. The sheep and the deer were
		terribly frightened, but they kept dancing
		on just the same. The tiger and wild cat
		<a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43"></a>were so happy dancing that they never noticed
		them at all. The big snakes curled
		their huge bodies about the tree trunks and
		wished that they, too, had feet with which to
		dance. The birds tried to dance, but they
		could not use their feet well enough and had
		to give it up and keep flying. Every beast
		of the forests and jungles which had feet
		with which to dance came and joined the gay
		procession.</p>

		<p>The jolly company wandered on and on
		until finally they came to the high wall which
		surrounds the land of the giants. The
		enormous giant who stood on the wall as
		guard laughed so hard that he almost fell off
		the wall. He took them to the king at once.
		The king laughed so hard that he almost fell
		off his throne. His laugh shook the earth.
		The earth had never before been shaken at
		the laugh of the king of the giants, though
		<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"></a>it had often heard his angry voice in the
		thunder. The people did not know what to
		make of it.</p>

		<p>Now it happened that the king of the land
		of giants had a beautiful giantess daughter
		who never laughed. She remained sad all
		the time. The king had offered half his
		kingdom to the one who could make her
		laugh, and all the giants had done their very
		funniest tricks for her. Never once had
		they brought even a tiny little smile to her
		lovely face. &#8220;If my daughter can keep from
		laughing when she sees this funny sight I&#8217;ll
		give up in despair and eat my hat,&#8221; said the
		king of the land of giants, as he saw the
		jolly little figure playing upon the violin
		and the assembly of cat, sheep, monkeys and
		everything else dancing to the gay music.
		If the giant king had known how to dance
		he would have danced himself, but it was
		<a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"></a>fortunate for the people of the earth that he
		did not know how. If he had, there is no
		knowing what might have happened to the
		earth.</p>

		<p>As it was, he took the little band into his
		daughter&#8217;s palace where she sat surrounded
		by her servants. Her lovely face was as sad
		as sad could be. When she saw the funny
		sight her expression changed. The happy
		smile which the king of the land of giants
		had always wanted to see played about her
		beautiful lips. A gay laugh was heard for
		the first time in all her life. The king of
		the land of giants was so happy that he grew
		a league in height and nobody knows how
		much he gained in weight. &#8220;You shall have
		half my kingdom,&#8221; he said to the boy, &#8220;just
		as I promised if any one made my daughter
		laugh.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The boy from that time on reigned over
		<a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"></a>half of the kingdom of giants as prince of
		the land. He never had the least bit of difficulty
		in preserving his authority, for the biggest
		giants would at once obey his slightest
		request if he played on his violin to them.
		The beasts stayed in the land of the giants
		so long that they grew into giant beasts, but
		the boy and his violin always remained just
		as they were when they entered the land.</p>

			THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS</h2>

		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Long</span> ago there was a king who was
		very ill. He wanted a hare killed
		to make him some broth. His only
		son, the prince, set out to find one. As the
		prince walked along the path to the forest
		a pretty little hare ran out of the hedge and
		crossed his path. He at once started in pursuit.
		The hare was a very swift runner.
		The prince followed her into the deep forest.
		Suddenly the hare ran into a hole in the
		ground. The prince kept in sight of her
		and soon found to his dismay that he was in
		a big cave. At the very rear of the cave
		<a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50"></a>there was the most enormous giant he had
		ever seen in his life.</p>

		<p>The prince was terribly frightened. &#8220;Oh,
		ho!&#8221; said the giant in such a deep savage
		voice that the cave echoed and re-echoed
		with his words. &#8220;You thought you&#8217;d catch
		my little hare, did you? Well, I&#8217;ve caught
		you instead!&#8221;</p>

		<p>The giant seized the prince in one of his
		enormous hands and tossed him lightly into
		a box at one end of the cave. He put the
		cover on the box and locked it down with a
		big key. The prince could get only a tiny
		bit of air through a little hole in the top, and
		he thought that he never could live. Hours
		passed. Sometimes the prince slept, but
		more often he lay there thinking about his
		sick father and what he could ever do to get
		out of the box and back once more to his
		father&#8217;s side.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51"></a>Suddenly he heard the key turn in the
		lock. The cover was lifted, and he saw
		standing before him the most beautiful
		maiden he had ever seen or dreamed of. &#8220;I
		am the hare you followed into the cave,&#8221;
		said she with a smile. &#8220;I am an enchanted
		princess and, though I have to take the form
		of a hare in the daytime, at night I am free
		to resume my own shape. You got into this
		trouble following me into the cave and I am
		so sorry for you that I am going to let you
		out.&#8221;</p>

		<div id="maiden" class="image">
			<a href="images/maiden.jpg"><img src="images/maiden.thumb.jpg" width="311" height="444" title="He saw standing before him the most beautiful maiden he had ever dreamed of" alt="A young man climbs from a box and sees a young woman." /></a>
		</div>

		<p>&#8220;You are so beautiful that I could stay
		here for ever and gaze into your lovely
		eyes,&#8221; said the prince.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You would see only a hare in the daytime,&#8221;
		replied the princess. &#8220;It is not always
		night. Besides, the giant may return
		at any moment. He just went out on a
		hunting trip because he thought that you
		<a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52"></a>would not make a sufficiently big supper for
		him. Don&#8217;t be foolish. I&#8217;ll show you the
		way out of the cave and then you must hurry
		home as fast as possible.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The prince thanked her for all her great
		kindness to him and acted upon her advice.
		He went home by the nearest path, but when
		he reached the palace his father was already
		dead. The palace was wrapped in mourning.</p>

		<p>The prince was so overcome with grief
		that he felt that he could not keep on living
		in the palace. After his father&#8217;s funeral he
		went away as a wanderer. He changed
		clothes with a poor fisherman whom he met
		by the river, for he did not wish to be recognized
		as the prince.</p>

		<p>Dressed as a poor fisherman he wandered
		from one kingdom to another. He caught
		fish for his food, and he soon recognized the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"></a>fact that the net which the fisherman had
		given him as part of his outfit was a most
		wonderful net. The biggest fish in the sea
		could not break through. &#8220;This net must
		have the special blessing of <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Nossa Senhora</em>
		upon it,&#8221; said the prince.</p>

		<p>In the course of his wanderings the prince
		arrived at a city where a great <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">festa</em> was being
		held. The palace was decked with gay
		banners. Every afternoon the messenger of
		the king rode up and down the city streets
		proclaiming, &#8220;The princess of our kingdom
		is the most beautiful princess in all the
		world.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The prince remembered the beautiful
		princess who had let him out of the giant&#8217;s
		cave. &#8220;Surely this princess cannot be as
		beautiful as she,&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;I am
		going to see this princess with my own eyes
		and find out.&#8221;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54"></a>Accordingly the prince went to the palace
		gate to watch for the princess. Soon she
		came to the balcony and leaned over the railing.
		She was very beautiful, but her nose
		was just a tiny bit crooked. She did not
		compare at all with the princess of the cave.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This princess is not by any means the
		most beautiful one in the world,&#8221; said the
		prince dressed as a fisherman. &#8220;I know
		where there is a princess who is much more
		beautiful.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The people standing by heard him. His
		words were at once reported to the royal
		guards. They seized him roughly and took
		him to the king.</p>

		<p>&#8220;So you are the fisherman who says that
		my daughter is not the most beautiful princess
		in the world?&#8221; said the king sternly.
		&#8220;You say, I hear, that you know a princess
		who is much more beautiful. I am a just
		<a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55"></a>king or else I should order that you be put
		to death immediately. As it is, I&#8217;ll give you
		the chance to prove what you say. If you
		are unable to fulfil your boast and show me
		this princess who in the opinion of my court
		is more beautiful than my daughter, you
		shall lose your life. Remember that you
		will have to bring her here to my court to
		have her beauty proven.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Thanks, your majesty,&#8221; said the prince.
		&#8220;If you will allow me two weeks to fulfil the
		contract, and if you&#8217;ll prepare a <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">festa</em> for the
		night two weeks hence, I&#8217;ll endeavour to present
		the most beautiful princess in the world
		to your assembled court.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The king was astonished at the fisherman&#8217;s
		words, for he had not thought that a poor
		fisherman like him knew many princesses.
		However, he allowed him to depart in search
		of the princess.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56"></a>Then the prince hurried home and once
		more walked toward the forest by the same
		path he had gone the day he went in search
		of the hare for his father&#8217;s broth. He soon
		found the place where the hare had crossed
		his path, and he did his best to remember
		the course they had followed as he pursued
		her into the forest.</p>

		<p>In the forest he saw evidences of what
		looked like a flood. The water had washed
		away every trace of the entrance of the cave.
		He dug and dug at the place where he
		thought it ought to be. He found nothing
		which seemed like the cave&#8217;s entrance.</p>

		<p>He dug and dug at a new place near by
		and soon he found his way barred by a massive
		door. The entrance to the cave was
		securely shut by it. The prince knocked at
		the door with all his might.</p>

		<p>Soon the door was opened a tiny bit and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57"></a>the face of a little old woman looked out.
		&#8220;I am the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">ama</em> of the princess,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
		think you are the prince she was expecting
		to return to deliver her from all the terrible
		calamities which have befallen her.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;What has happened to my beautiful
		princess who saved my life?&#8221; asked the
		prince. &#8220;I am indeed the prince, but I am
		surprised that you should recognize me in
		my fisherman&#8217;s garb.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;The princess told me that I would know
		you by the smile in your eyes,&#8221; replied the
		old <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">ama</em>. &#8220;I did not look at your clothes at
		all. I looked at your eyes. You have the
		smile in them though your face is sad.
		Come into the cave, and I will tell you all
		that has happened.&#8221;</p>

		<p>When the prince was inside the cave she
		hastily barred the door and said, &#8220;When the
		giant returned he was terribly angry at the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58"></a>princess because she had let you escape. He
		seized her roughly and put her into the box in
		your place. The princess had thrown away
		the key to the box when she let you out;
		and, search as he would, the giant was unable
		to find it again anywhere. That made
		him even angrier than before. All day he
		sits on the top of the chest when the princess
		is in the form of the hare. At night when
		he goes away he causes a great river to flow
		around the entrance to the cave. He has
		placed a huge fish as guard to the entrance.
		This fish swims up and down before our
		door and calls out such vile names at the
		princess, that, when she is in her own form,
		she stays in the box and stuffs cotton in her
		ears. You got here just as the giant had
		left. The water must have risen as soon
		as you were inside our door. I hear the
		fish now.&#8221;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59"></a>Even as she spoke the prince heard the
		voice of the fish. It said such terrible words
		that the prince was glad that the princess was
		in the box with cotton in ears. &#8220;You get
		into the box with the princess,&#8221; he said to
		the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">ama</em>. &#8220;I am a good swimmer and I am
		going to open the door and swim out. The
		box is made of wood that will float; so, inside
		of it, you and the princess will float out
		to safety.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;How will you ever swim past this terrible
		fish?&#8221; asked the old <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">ama</em>.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Do not fear,&#8221; replied the prince. &#8220;I
		have with me a net which is so strong that
		the biggest, fiercest fish in the world cannot
		break it. I will catch the fish in it. Just
		wait and you will see. In the meantime
		take the cotton out of the ears of the princess
		and tell her that I am here. Quiet her fears
		and stay in the box for a few moments.&#8221;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60"></a>The old <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">ama</em> got into the box as the prince
		had commanded. Then he unbarred the
		great door. The fish swam at him fiercely,
		but the prince quickly entangled him in his
		strong net. Holding him fast in the net, the
		prince swam up to the surface of the water
		and was soon on the bank of the raging river.
		Then he killed the fish and scaled it and put
		the scales in his pocket.</p>

		<p>The box had floated up to the surface of
		the water as the prince had said it would.
		The prince threw his net over it and drew
		it to land. The <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">ama</em> and the beautiful
		princess stepped out. The princess was so
		lovely that the prince fell upon his knees
		before her. The sight of her great beauty
		almost blinded his eyes.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I knew all the time that you would come
		back again,&#8221; said the princess. &#8220;I knew that
		you would deliver me from my troubles, but
		<a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61"></a>you have been a long time getting here.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The prince told the princess all that had
		happened to him. &#8220;You saved my life from
		the giant,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I am very glad to have
		had an opportunity to save your life for
		you. Now I must ask you to again save my
		life.&#8221; Then he told about the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">festa</em> at
		which he must display the most beautiful
		princess in the world or forfeit his life.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll gladly go to the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">festa</em> with you,&#8221; said
		the princess. &#8220;It is fortunate that it is held
		at night.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Princess and her <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">ama</em> travelled
		quickly with the prince to the kingdom which
		claimed to possess the most beautiful princess
		in the world. It was already the night
		of the appointed <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">festa</em> when they arrived.
		The king&#8217;s army was drawn up to slay the
		prince. No one dreamed that the poor
		fisherman would be able to bring any princess
		<a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62"></a>at all with him, much less a beautiful
		one. The prince hid the princess in the box
		which the old <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">ama</em> carried on top of her head.</p>

		<p>When the poor fisherman stood before the
		king with an old <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">ama</em> standing by his side, a
		great laugh ran through the king&#8217;s court.
		&#8220;We knew that the fisherman would never
		be able to bring a princess more beautiful
		than our own lovely princess,&#8221; said the
		courtiers one to another. &#8220;But see what he
		has brought in her place!&#8221; Then they
		laughed and laughed until they could hardly
		stand.</p>

		<p>The king&#8217;s soldiers stepped forward to
		seize the fisherman to put him to death.
		&#8220;Grant me just one moment more of life,&#8221;
		begged the prince.</p>

		<p>The king nodded his head and the prince
		put his hand into the pocket of his fisherman&#8217;s
		coat. He pulled out a handful of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63"></a>silver scales. The most beautiful silvery
		cloud filled the room.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Just a moment more,&#8221; begged the prince.
		Then he pulled a handful of golden scales
		from out his pocket. The most beautiful
		golden cloud filled the room.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Please just another little minute,&#8221; asked
		the prince and he pulled out a handful of
		jewelled scales from his pocket. The most
		wonderful sparkling cloud of jewels fell
		about them. As the cloud cleared away
		there stood the most beautiful princess any
		one had ever seen or dreamed of between the
		old <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">ama</em> and the prince in the fisherman
		clothes.</p>

		<p>The soldiers drew back. The king looked
		at the floor and so did all the courtiers.
		&#8220;You have won your wager,&#8221; said the king
		when he could find his voice. &#8220;Our daughter
		is not the most beautiful princess in the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page64" title="64"></a>whole world. I see myself that her nose is
		a tiny bit crooked.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The prince and princess and the old <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">ama</em>
		went back to the prince&#8217;s own kingdom
		where the wedding of the prince and princess
		was celebrated with a great feast. From
		the moment that the fish scales fell upon the
		princess her enchantment was broken and
		she never became a hare again. She and the
		prince lived together happily in the prince&#8217;s
		palace, and the giant never troubled them
		again, though they were always careful to
		keep away from the forest.</p>

			THE LITTLE SISTER OF THE GIANTS</h2>

		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Once</span> upon a time there was a little
		girl who was very beautiful. Her
		eyes were like the eyes of the
		gazelle; her hair hid in its soft waves the
		deep shadows of the night; her smile was like
		the sunrise. Each year as she grew older she
		grew also more and more beautiful. Her
		name was Angelita.</p>

		<p>The little girl&#8217;s mother was dead, and her
		father, the image-maker, had married a second
		time. The step-mother was a woman
		who was renowned in the city for her great
		beauty. As her little step-daughter grew
		<a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68"></a>more and more lovely each day of her life
		she soon became jealous of the child. Each
		night she asked the image-maker, &#8220;Who is
		more beautiful, your wife or your child?&#8221;</p>

		<p>The image-maker was a wise man and
		knew all too well his wife&#8217;s jealous disposition.
		He always responded, &#8220;You, my
		wife, are absolutely peerless.&#8221;</p>

		<p>One day the image-maker suddenly died,
		and the step-mother and step-daughter were
		left alone in the world. They both mourned
		deeply the passing of the kind image-maker.</p>

		<p>One day as they were leaning over the
		balcony two passers-by observed them, and
		one said to the other, &#8220;Do you notice those
		beautiful women in the balcony? The
		mother is beautiful, but the daughter is far
		more beautiful.&#8221; The step-mother had always
		been jealous of the daughter&#8217;s loveliness,
		but now her jealousy was fanned into
		<a class="pagenum" id="page69" title="69"></a>a burning flame. The wise image-maker
		was no longer there to tell her that she was
		peerless.</p>

		<p>The next day the mother and daughter
		again leaned over the balcony. Two soldiers
		passed by and one said to the other:
		&#8220;Do you observe those two beautiful women
		in the balcony? The mother is beautiful,
		but the daughter is far more beautiful.&#8221;
		The step-mother flew into a terrible rage.
		She now knew that it was true as she had
		long feared. The girl was more beautiful
		than she. Her jealousy knew no bounds.
		She seized her step-daughter roughly and
		shut her up in a little room in the attic.</p>

		<p>The little room in the attic had just one
		tiny window high up in the wall. The window
		was shut, but Angelita climbed up to
		open it in order to get a little air. The
		next afternoon she grew weary of the confinement
		<a class="pagenum" id="page70" title="70"></a>of the little room, so she dug a
		foothold in the wall where she could stand
		and look out of the window. Her step-mother
		was leaning over the balcony all
		alone when two <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cavalheiros</em> passed by. One
		said to the other, &#8220;Do you observe the beautiful
		woman in the balcony?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied
		the other. &#8220;She is a beautiful woman,
		but the little maid who is kept a prisoner in
		the attic is far more beautiful.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The step-mother became desperate. She
		ordered the old negro servant to carry the
		girl into the jungle and kill her. &#8220;Be sure
		that you bring back the tip of Angelita&#8217;s
		tongue, so that I may know that you have
		obeyed my order,&#8221; she said.</p>

		<p>Angelita was very happy to be taken out
		of the little attic room, and set out for a walk
		with the old negro with a light heart. They
		walked through the city streets and out into
		<a class="pagenum" id="page71" title="71"></a>the open country. Soon they had reached
		the deep jungle. &#8220;Where are we going?&#8221;
		the girl asked in surprise.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We are taking a walk for our health,
		<em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">yayazinha</em>,&#8221; replied the old negro.</p>

		<p>Soon they were so far in the jungle that
		the path was entirely overgrown. No ray
		of light penetrated through the deep foliage.
		Angelita became frightened. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not go
		another step if you do not tell me where you
		are taking me,&#8221; she said as she stamped her
		little foot upon the ground.</p>

		<p>The old negro burst into tears and told
		Angelita all that her step-mother had commanded.
		&#8220;I could not hurt one hair of your
		lovely head, much less cut off the tip of your
		little tongue, <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">yayazinha</em>,&#8221; sobbed the old
		man.</p>

		<p>Angelita stood still and thought. &#8220;Go
		back to my step-mother,&#8221; she said to the old
		<a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72"></a>man. &#8220;On the way you will see plenty of
		dogs. Cut off the tip of a little dog&#8217;s tongue
		and carry it home to my step-mother.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is what the old negro did. The step-mother
		believed him and thought that he had
		slain her step-daughter according to her command.</p>

		<p>Angelita, in the meantime, wandered on
		and on through the jungle. The big snakes
		glided swiftly out of her path. The
		monkeys and the parrots chattered to keep
		her from being lonely. She wandered on
		and on until finally she came to an enormous
		palace. The front door was wide open.
		She went from room to room, but the palace
		was entirely deserted. There was not a
		neat, orderly room in the entire palace.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I can make these lovely rooms neat and
		clean,&#8221; said Angelita. &#8220;They surely need
		some one to do it!&#8221; She found a broom and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page73" title="73"></a>went to work at once. Soon the whole
		palace was in order once more. Everything
		was clean and bright.</p>

		<p>Just as Angelita was finishing her task
		she heard a great noise. She looked out of
		the door, and there were three enormous
		giants entering the house. She had never
		dreamed that giants could be so big. She
		was frightened nearly to death and
		scrambled under a chair as fast as she could.</p>

		<p>When the giants came into the house they
		were amazed to find everything in such
		splendid order. &#8220;This is a different looking
		place from what we left,&#8221; said the biggest
		giant.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What dirty, disorderly giants we have
		been, living here all by ourselves,&#8221; said the
		middle-sized giant. &#8220;I just realize it, now
		that I see what our house looks like when it
		is neat and clean.&#8221;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page74" title="74"></a>&#8220;What kind fairy could have done all this
		work while we were away?&#8221; said the littlest
		giant, who was not little at all, but almost as
		big as his enormous brothers.</p>

		<p>The three giants fell to discussing the
		question. They could not guess how their
		house could have been made so clean.
		Their voices were so very kind, in spite of being
		so loud and heavy, that Angelita decided
		she dare come out from under the chair and
		let them see who had done the work for them.
		She quickly crawled out from her hiding
		place.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What lovely fairy is this?&#8221; asked the
		biggest giant, looking at her kindly. He
		thought that she really was a fairy.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This is the loveliest fairy I ever saw in
		all my life,&#8221; said the middle-sized giant.</p>

		<p>&#8220;How did such a lovely fairy ever happen
		to find our dirty, disorderly palace?&#8221; asked
		<a class="pagenum" id="page75" title="75"></a>the littlest giant who was not little at all.</p>

		<p>Angelita told the three giants her story.
		Her beauty and her sweet ways completely
		entranced them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Please live with us always here in our
		palace in the jungle and be our little sister,&#8221;
		said the biggest giant, and the middle-sized
		giant and the littlest giant, speaking all at
		once. Their three big deep voices all together
		made a noise like thunder.</p>

		<p>Angelita lived in the palace with the three
		giants after that. Every day when they
		went out to hunt she would take the broom
		and make the palace neat and clean. They
		called her &#8220;little sister&#8221; and loved her with
		all their big giant hearts.</p>

		<p>All was well until a little bird went and
		told Angelita&#8217;s step-mother that she was
		alive and living in the depths of the jungle
		with the three giants. When the step-mother
		<a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76"></a>heard about it she was so angry that
		she thought she could never be happy as long
		as Angelita was living in the world. She
		consulted a wicked witch as soon as she could
		find her shawl.</p>

		<p>The wicked witch gave the step-mother
		some poisoned slippers. &#8220;These will cause
		the immediate death of any person who puts
		them on,&#8221; said the wicked witch. Then she
		showed the step-mother just how to reach the
		palace where Angelita lived in the depths of
		the jungle with the three giants.</p>

		<p>Angelita&#8217;s step-mother followed the directions
		which the witch had given her and
		easily found the giants&#8217; palace. Angelita
		was so happy living with the giants and
		keeping house for them that she had forgotten
		what fear was like. She was not frightened
		at all when she heard some one clap
		<a class="pagenum" id="page77" title="77"></a>hands before the door one day when the
		giants were away. She went to the door;
		and, though she was very much surprised to
		see her step-mother, she invited her into the
		house. Her step-mother gave her a loving
		embrace and kissed her upon both cheeks.
		&#8220;Dear child, it is a long time since I have
		seen you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have brought you a
		little gift to show you that I have not forgotten
		you. It is only a poor, mean little
		gift, but it is the best I could bring.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Angelita was touched at her step-mother&#8217;s
		gift and accepted it with hearty thanks.
		As soon as her step-mother had gone she untied
		the red ribbon around the package and
		opened it. Inside was a pair of leather slippers.
		Angelita looked at the little slippers.
		They were like the slippers which her dear
		father, the image-maker, had once brought
		<a class="pagenum" id="page78" title="78"></a>home to her. &#8220;How kind it was in my step-mother
		to bring these slippers to me,&#8221; she
		said as she put them on.</p>

		<p>As soon as the slippers were on Angelita&#8217;s
		feet, she fell dead just as the wicked witch
		had promised the step-mother she would do.
		Her step-mother was watching through the
		window, and when she saw Angelita dead
		she hurried home in joy. &#8220;Now I, alone,
		am the peerless beauty,&#8221; she said.</p>

		<p>When the three giants came home to dinner
		they knew at once that there was something
		wrong. There were dirty tracks on
		the floor and dirty finger prints upon the
		door. &#8220;Who made these dirty marks?&#8221; said
		the biggest giant.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What has happened to our dear little
		sister that she has not cleaned them away?&#8221;
		asked the middle-sized giant.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I am afraid there is something wrong
		<a class="pagenum" id="page79" title="79"></a>with little sister,&#8221; said the littlest giant who
		was not little at all.</p>

		<p>They clapped their big hands before the
		door, but no smiling little sister ran to meet
		them. They entered the big hall of the
		palace with a bound. There in the middle
		of the floor lay Angelita, just as she had
		fallen when she put on the poisoned slippers
		which her step-mother had given her.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What evil, has befallen our dear little
		sister?&#8221; said the biggest giant.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Who could have slain our little sister
		whom we loved so much?&#8221; said the middle-sized
		giant.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Who will keep house for us now that our
		dear little sister is dead?&#8221; asked the littlest
		giant.</p>

		<p>Then the biggest giant and the middle-sized
		giant and the littlest giant all began
		to sob so loud that it shook the earth. &#8220;Our
		<a class="pagenum" id="page80" title="80"></a>dear little sister is dead! What shall we
		do! What shall we do!&#8221;</p>

		<p>The giants could not go into the city to
		give their little sister Christian burial, but
		they built a beautiful casket out of silver and
		carried it to the path which led to the city.
		Then they hid themselves to watch and
		make sure that some one found it to carry
		to the burying place.</p>

		<p>Soon a handsome prince passed by on
		horseback. He noticed the silver casket at
		once and opened it. The girl whose still
		form lay inside was the most beautiful maid
		he had ever gazed upon. &#8220;This dead maid
		is my own true love,&#8221; he said and he carried
		the silver casket home to his own palace.</p>

		<p>He commanded that no one should enter
		the room where he placed the silver casket,
		and this aroused the curiosity of his little
		sister at once. At the very first opportunity
		<a class="pagenum" id="page81" title="81"></a>she slipped into the room. She opened the
		casket and was surprised to see the beautiful
		quiet maid. &#8220;You are very lovely,&#8221; she
		said to the still form, &#8220;all except your slippers.
		I think they are very ugly.&#8221; With
		these words she pulled off the leather slippers.</p>

		<p>Angelita gave a deep sigh, opened her
		beautiful eyes, and asked for a drink of
		water.</p>

		<p>The little sister called the prince at once.
		When he saw Angelita was really alive he
		could hardly believe the good fortune. He
		asked that the wedding night be celebrated
		immediately.</p>

		<p>Angelita begged that she might go back
		into the deep jungle and invite the three
		giants to the wedding. The biggest giant,
		the middle-sized giant, and the littlest giant
		who was not little at all, came to the wedding
		<a class="pagenum" id="page82" title="82"></a>feast. After that they visited their little
		sister often at her new home; and, when
		she had children of her own, it was the funniest
		sight one ever saw to see the biggest
		giant hold the tiny babes upon his knee.</p>

			THE FOREST LAD AND THE WICKED GIANT</h2>

		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Once</span> upon a time there was a man
		who took his wife and tiny baby
		son into the deep forest to make
		their home. With his own hands he built
		the house out of mud, and he made for it a
		thatched roof from the grass of the forest.
		For food they depended upon the fruits of
		the forest and the beasts which they killed in
		the hunt. They lived like hermits, seeing
		no one.</p>

		<p>As the baby son grew into a large strong
		boy he learned from his father all the secrets
		of the forest. He grew wise as well as
		<a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86"></a>strong. From his mother he heard stories of
		their former life in the great city which had
		been their home before they went to live in
		the forest. These were the tales he loved
		to hear best of all. Very often when his
		father went out into the forest to hunt the
		boy would beg to remain at home with his
		mother. While his father was away she
		would sit on the ground before their hut and
		unfold to the boy all her memories of their
		old life.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said the lad one day after his
		father had returned from his hunting trip,
		&#8220;I am tired of living here in the forest all
		by ourselves. Let us return to the city to
		live.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Your mother has been telling tales to
		you,&#8221; replied his father. &#8220;I will see to it
		that she never mentions the city to you
		again. We left the city to save our lives.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page87" title="87"></a>Let me never hear from you another word
		about returning to the city.&#8221;</p>

		<p>After that the lad was made to accompany
		his father when he went out hunting. There
		was no more opportunity to hear the tales
		he loved from his mother&#8217;s lips. Nevertheless
		he hid away in his mind all that his
		mother had told him of their old life; and
		at night, when the fierce storms in the forest
		or the sound of the wild beasts would not
		let him sleep, he often lay awake upon his
		mat on the floor of the hut, pondering over
		the stories she had told.</p>

		<p>At last the father grew sick of a fever and
		died. Now that the lad and his mother were
		left alone in the forest the lad said, &#8220;Come,
		let us return to our home in the city. Let
		us not stay here alone in the forest any
		longer. I must live in my own life the tales
		you have told me of the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">festas</em> and the dancing,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page88" title="88"></a>the great tournaments, and the songs
		at night under the balconies of the fair
		maidens.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The lad&#8217;s request was so urgent that his
		mother could not have refused him, even if
		she, in her own heart, was not longing for
		a return to the life of the city. Accordingly,
		they took all their possessions, which consisted
		only of a horse and a sword, and set out
		for the city.</p>

		<p>The lad and his mother reached the city at
		nightfall. They went from one street to
		another, but saw no living being. They
		knocked and clapped their hands before all
		the doors of the city, but no one responded.
		At last they reached the street where their
		old home had been. The lad was delighted
		to see what a big handsome house it was.
		&#8220;No wonder my mother longed to return to a
		home like this,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;How could
		<a class="pagenum" id="page89" title="89"></a>she ever have endured the rude hut in the
		depths of the forest?&#8221;</p>

		<p>The doors of the beautiful house stood
		wide open. The lad and his mother entered,
		and passed from one room to another.
		His mother saw one room after another with
		everything unchanged. She recognized one
		object after another just as she had left it.
		There was one room in the house which was
		securely barred on the inside, however.</p>

		<p>The lad and his mother spent the night in
		their old home. In the morning they again
		walked about the deserted streets of the city.
		They saw no one and heard no living sound.
		It was like a city of the dead. They grew
		hungry at length; and the lad went outside
		the city to seek for food in the forest, according
		to the custom which he had known all his
		life.</p>

		<p>The mother returned to her old home to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90"></a>await the coming of her son. As soon as she
		went upstairs she saw that the barred door
		was wide open. There in the hall stood
		the most enormous giant she had ever seen.
		The great halls of the house were high, but
		the giant could not stand up in them without
		stooping.</p>

		</div>

		<p>&#8220;Who are you and what are you doing in
		my house?&#8221; roared the giant in such a terrible
		voice that the house trembled.</p>

		<p>The woman who had lived so many years
		in the forest was not easily frightened.
		&#8220;Who are you and what are you doing in my
		house?&#8221; she shouted at the giant in the loudest
		tones she could muster.</p>

		<p>One might have expected that the giant
		would have killed her instantly, but on the
		contrary her bold answer pleased him exceedingly.
		He laughed so hard that he had to
		lean against the wall to keep from falling.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page91" title="91"></a>&#8220;So you think that this is your house, do
		you?&#8221; said the giant as soon as he could regain
		his voice. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what
		we can do. I like you, and we can share this
		house if you will consent to be my wife.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I am not alone,&#8221; said the lad&#8217;s mother as
		soon as she could recover from her surprise
		sufficiently to find words. &#8220;My son is with
		me and I am expecting him any moment to
		return from the forest whither he has gone
		to procure food for us.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I can dispose of your son very quickly,
		just as I have destroyed all the inhabitants
		of this city,&#8221; said the giant with a frown.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You cannot dispose of my son so easily
		as you may think,&#8221; replied his mother.
		&#8220;He has grown in the deep forest and is very
		strong, far stronger than the city dwellers.
		Besides his great strength, he is surrounded
		by the magic circle of his mother&#8217;s love.&#8221;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page92" title="92"></a>&#8220;I do not know what the magic circle of
		a mother&#8217;s love is like,&#8221; said the giant. &#8220;I
		don&#8217;t remember having seen one anywhere.
		Nevertheless I like you, and because I like
		you I will endeavour to dispose of your son
		as painlessly as possible. I believe you say
		you are expecting him any moment. Just
		lie down here and pretend that you are sick.
		When the boy comes in tell him that you
		have a terrible pain in your eyes. As you
		have lived long in the forest you will know
		that the best remedy for a pain in your eyes
		is the oil of the deadly <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cobra</em> of the jungle.
		Send the lad out into the jungle to obtain
		this oil for you, and I promise you he will
		never return alive. I&#8217;ll go back into my
		room and bar the door so the boy will never
		see me, but I shall listen through the wall to
		know whether you carry out my command.&#8221;</p>

		<p>At that very moment they heard the lad&#8217;s
		<a class="pagenum" id="page93" title="93"></a>footsteps and his gay voice at the door.
		The giant went inside his room and barred
		the door. The lad&#8217;s mother lay down with a
		cloth over her eyes, moaning in loud tones.
		&#8220;The giant little knows the strength and
		skill of the lad whose mother I am,&#8221; she said
		to herself as she smiled amidst her moans and
		groans.</p>

		<p>&#8220;O dear little mother, what evil has befallen
		you during my absence?&#8221; asked the
		boy as he entered the room.</p>

		<p>His mother complained of the pain in her
		eyes just as the giant had instructed. &#8220;The
		only thing which will cure me of this terrible
		affliction is the oil of the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cobra</em>,&#8221; she said.</p>

		<p>The boy well knew the dangers which attended
		securing the oil from the deadly
		<em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cobra</em> of the jungle, but never in his life had
		he disregarded a request from his mother.
		He at once set out for the jungle; and, in
		<a class="pagenum" id="page94" title="94"></a>spite of the perils of the deed, he succeeded
		in obtaining the oil which his mother had requested.</p>

		<p>On the way back to the city, the boy met a
		little old woman carrying a pole over her
		shoulder from which there hung, head downward,
		several live fowls which she was taking
		to market. It was really the Holy
		Mother herself who had come to aid the lad
		in answer to his mother&#8217;s prayer.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Where are you going, my lad?&#8221; asked the
		old woman. The boy told his story and
		showed the precious oil which he had obtained
		from the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cobra</em>. &#8220;The day is coming,
		the day is coming, my lad, when you
		will, in truth, need the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cobra&#8217;s</em> oil,&#8221; said the
		little old woman. &#8220;But that day is not today.
		Today hen&#8217;s oil will serve your purpose
		just as well. You may kill one of my
		hens and use the hen&#8217;s oil, but leave the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page95" title="95"></a><em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cobra&#8217;s</em> oil with me so that I may keep it
		safely for you until the day when you will
		require it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The boy heeded the advice of the little
		old woman and killed one of her hens. He
		left the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cobra&#8217;s</em> oil with her and took the hen&#8217;s
		oil in its place to his mother. Because his
		mother had nothing at all the matter with
		her eyes, the hen&#8217;s oil cured them just as well
		as the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cobra&#8217;s</em> oil. There was no one who
		knew the difference, except the boy and the
		little old woman.</p>

		<p>When the boy had gone out the giant came
		in from his own room and said, &#8220;In truth
		your son is a brave lad. I did not dream
		that he would have the courage to go in
		search of the oil of the deadly <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cobra</em>, much
		less succeed in his quest.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;You do not know the great love we bear
		each other,&#8221; said the lad&#8217;s mother.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page96" title="96"></a>&#8220;I am going to demand a new proof of
		your son&#8217;s strength and skill,&#8221; said the giant.
		&#8220;Tomorrow you must complain of the pain
		in your back and send the boy in search of
		the oil of the porcupine to cure it. This is
		my command.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The next day the woman had to complain
		of a pain in her back just as the giant had
		commanded. There was nothing else which
		she could do. The boy at once went in
		search of a porcupine, and succeeded in slaying
		one and getting the oil.</p>

		<p>On his way back to the city the lad again
		met the little old woman who was really
		<em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Nossa Senhora</em>. &#8220;Leave the oil of the porcupine
		with me, my son,&#8221; said she when she
		had heard his story. &#8220;I will keep it for you
		until the morrow when you will have great
		need of it. Today hen&#8217;s oil will serve your
		purpose just as well.&#8221;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page97" title="97"></a>Because the boy&#8217;s mother had nothing at
		all the matter with her back she was cured
		with the hen&#8217;s oil which the boy brought,
		just as easily as if it had been the porcupine&#8217;s
		oil. The giant came out of his room and
		said, &#8220;In truth, lad, you are a boy of great
		skill and strength.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The boy had not seen the giant before and
		he was very much surprised. Before he
		even had time to recover from his amazement
		the giant had seized him and bound
		him securely with a great rope. &#8220;If you are
		really a strong boy you will break this rope,&#8221;
		said the giant. &#8220;If you are not strong
		enough to break it I shall cut you into five
		pieces with my sword.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The boy struggled with all his might to
		break the great rope. It was no use. He
		was not strong enough. The giant stood by
		laughing.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page98" title="98"></a>When the lad&#8217;s mother saw that he could
		not break the rope she fell upon her knees
		before the giant and cried, &#8220;Do what you
		will to me, but spare my son!&#8221;</p>

		<p>The cruel giant laughed at her request.
		When she saw that she could not keep him
		from slaying the boy, she said, &#8220;If you will
		not grant my large request I beg that you
		will listen to just a tiny, tiny, little one.
		When you cut my son into five pieces do it
		with his father&#8217;s sword which he has brought
		with him from the little hut in the forest
		where we used to live. Then bind his body
		upon the back of his father&#8217;s horse which he
		brought with him out of the forest and turn
		the horse loose, so it may travel, perchance,
		back to the forest from which I brought my
		lad to meet this terrible death.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The giant did as she requested, and the
		horse bore the slain boy&#8217;s body along the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page99" title="99"></a>road to the forest. Outside the city they
		met the little old woman who was really
		<em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Nossa Senhora</em>. She took the parts of the
		lad&#8217;s body and anointed them with the porcupine&#8217;s
		oil. Then she held them tight
		together. They stayed securely joined.
		&#8220;Are you lacking anything,&#8221; she asked the
		boy.</p>

		<p>The boy felt of his legs, his arms, his ears,
		his nose, his hair. &#8220;I am all here except my
		eyesight,&#8221; he said. The little old woman
		anointed his eyes with the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cobra&#8217;s</em> oil. His
		sight was immediately restored. Then he
		knew that the little old woman was indeed
		the Holy Mother. She vanished as he knelt
		to receive her blessing.</p>

		<p>The boy in his new strength quickly
		hastened back to the city. It was night and
		the giant was asleep. He seized his father&#8217;s
		sword and plunged it into the giant&#8217;s body.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page100" title="100"></a>The giant turned over without awakening.
		&#8220;The mosquitoes are biting me,&#8221; he muttered
		in his sleep.</p>

		<p>The boy saw the giant&#8217;s own enormous
		sword lying on the floor. It was so heavy
		he could barely lift it, but mustering all his
		strength he drove it into the giant&#8217;s body.
		The giant died immediately.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The magic circle of a mother&#8217;s love, with
		the Holy Mother&#8217;s help, will guard a lad
		against all perils,&#8221; said the boy&#8217;s mother
		when she heard her son&#8217;s story and saw the
		giant lying dead.</p>

			HOW THE GIANTESS GUIMARA BECAME SMALL</h2>

		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Once</span> upon a time a prince called
		D. Joa&otilde; went hunting with a
		number of companions. In the
		deep forest he became separated from his
		comrades and soon found out that he was
		lost. He wandered about for a long time,
		and at last he spied what looked like a mountain
		range in the distance. He journeyed
		toward it as fast as he could travel, and
		when he got near to it he was surprised to
		find out that it was really a high wall. It
		was the great wall which bounds the land of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page104" title="104"></a>the giants. The ruler of the country was
		an enormous giant whose head reached almost
		to the clouds. The giant&#8217;s wife was
		nearly as enormous as he was, and their only
		child was as tall as her mother. Her name
		was Guimara.</p>

		<p>When the giant saw D. Joa&otilde; he called
		out, &#8220;O, little man, what are you doing
		down there?&#8221; D. Joa&otilde; narrated his adventures
		to the giant, and the giant said, &#8220;Your
		story of your wanderings interests me. It
		is not often that little men like you pass this
		way. If you like you may live in my palace
		and be my servant.&#8221; D. Joa&otilde; accepted the
		giant&#8217;s offer and stayed at the palace.</p>

		<div id="guimara" class="image">
			<a href="images/guimara.jpg"><img src="images/guimara.thumb.jpg" width="316" height="446" alt="A seated young woman regards a young man who is less than half her size." title="The giant's daughter, Guimara was very much pleased with D. Jo&atilde;o" /></a>
		</div>

		<p>The giant&#8217;s daughter Guimara was very
		much pleased with D. Joa&otilde;. He was the
		first little man she had ever seen. She fell
		deeply in love with him. Her father, however,
		was very much disgusted at her lack of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page105" title="105"></a>good taste. He preferred to have a giant
		for a son-in-law. Accordingly he thought
		of a plot to get D. Joa&otilde; into trouble.</p>

		<p>The next day he sent for D. Joa&otilde; to appear
		before him. &#8220;O little man,&#8221; he said
		to him, &#8220;they tell me that you are very proud
		of yourself and that you are boasting among
		my servants that you are able to tear down
		my palace in a single night and set it up
		again as quickly as you tore it down.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I never have made any such boast, your
		majesty,&#8221; replied D. Joa&otilde;.</p>

		<p>He went to Guimara and told her about
		it. &#8220;I am an enchantress,&#8221; said Guimara.
		&#8220;Leave it to me and we will surprise my
		father.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The very next night Guimara and D.
		Joa&otilde; tore down the giant&#8217;s palace and set it
		up again exactly as it was before. The
		giant was greatly surprised. He suspected
		<a class="pagenum" id="page106" title="106"></a>that his daughter had meddled with the affair.</p>

		<p>The next day he sent for D. Joa&otilde; and said
		to him, &#8220;O little man, they tell me that
		you say that in a single night you are able
		to change the Isle of Wild Beasts into a
		beautiful garden full of all sorts of flowers
		and with a silvery fountain in the centre.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I never said any such thing, your majesty,&#8221;
		replied D. Joa&otilde;.</p>

		<p>He told Guimara about it and she said
		that it would be great fun to escape from her
		room that night and make over the Isle of
		the Wild Beasts into a lovely garden.</p>

		<p>Accordingly Guimara worked hard all
		night long helping D. Joa&otilde; to make the Isle
		of the Wild Beasts over into a garden full of
		all sorts of beautiful flowers and with a
		silvery fountain in the centre. The king
		was greatly surprised to see the garden in the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page107" title="107"></a>morning and he was very angry at Guimara
		and D. Joa&otilde;.</p>

		<p>Guimara was so frightened at her father&#8217;s
		terrible wrath that she decided to run away
		with D. Joa&otilde;. She counselled him to procure
		the best horse from her father&#8217;s stable
		for them to ride.</p>

		<p>At midnight Guimara crept out of her
		room and ran to the place where D. Joa&otilde;
		was waiting for her with the horse, which
		travelled one hundred leagues at each step.
		They mounted the horse and rode away.</p>

		<p>Early the next morning the princess Guimara
		was missed from the royal palace.
		Soon it was discovered that D. Joa&otilde; was
		gone too, and also the best horse from the
		stables. The giant talked over the matter
		with his wife. She told him to take another
		horse which could travel a hundred leagues
		a step and go after them as fast as he
		<a class="pagenum" id="page108" title="108"></a>could. The giant followed his wife&#8217;s advice,
		and soon he had nearly caught up with
		the fugitives, for they had grown tired and
		had stopped to rest.</p>

		<p>Guimara spied her father coming and
		turned herself into a little river. She
		turned D. Joa&otilde; into an old negro, the horse
		into a tree, the saddle into a bed of onions,
		and the musket they carried into a butterfly.</p>

		<p>When the giant came to the river he called
		out to the old negro who was taking a bath,
		&#8220;O, my old negro, have you seen anything of
		a little man accompanied by a handsome
		young woman?&#8221;</p>

		<p>The old negro did not say a single word to
		him, but dived into the water. When he
		came out he called the giant&#8217;s attention to
		the bed of onions. &#8220;I planted these onions,&#8221;
		he said. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t they a good crop?&#8221;</p>

		<p>The bed of onions smelled so strong that
		<a class="pagenum" id="page109" title="109"></a>the giant did not like to stay near them.
		The butterfly flew at the giant&#8217;s eyes and
		almost into them. He was disgusted and
		went home to talk it over with his wife.</p>

		<p>&#8220;How silly you were,&#8221; said the giant&#8217;s
		wife. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that Guimara had
		changed herself into a river and had changed
		D. Joa&otilde; into an old negro, the horse into a
		tree, the saddle into a bed of onions, and the
		musket into a butterfly? Hurry after them
		at once.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The giant again went in pursuit, promising
		his wife that next time he would not let
		Guimara play any tricks on him. The next
		time that Guimara saw her father coming
		she thought of a new plan. She changed
		herself into a church. She turned D. Joa&otilde;
		into a <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">padre</em>, the horse into a bell, the saddle
		into an altar and the musket into a mass-book.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page110" title="110"></a>When the giant approached the church
		he was completely deceived. &#8220;O, holy
		<em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">padre</em>,&#8221; he said to the priest, &#8220;have you seen
		anything of a little man, accompanied by a
		handsome young woman, passing this way?&#8221;</p>

		<p>The <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">padre</em> went on with his mass and said:</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<p>&#8220;I am a hermit <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">padre</em></p>
			<p>Devoted to the Immaculate;</p>
			<p>I do not hear what you say.</p>
			<p><em xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dominus vobiscum.</em>&#8221;</p>
		</div>

		<p>The giant could get no other response
		from him. At last he gave up in despair and
		went home to talk things over with his wife.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Of all stupid fools you are the most
		stupid of all,&#8221; said his wife when she had
		heard the tale. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that Guimara
		has changed herself into a church, D.
		Joa&otilde; into a priest, the horse into a bell, the
		saddle into the altar, and the musket into the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page111" title="111"></a>mass-book? Hurry after them again as fast
		as you can. I am going with you, myself,
		this time, to see that Guimara does not play
		any more tricks on you.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This time the fugitives had travelled far
		when Guimara&#8217;s parents overtook them.
		They had almost reached D. Joa&otilde;&#8217;s own
		kingdom. Guimara threw a handful of dust
		into her parents&#8217; eyes, and it became so dark
		that they could not see. Guimara and D.
		Joa&otilde; escaped safely into his own kingdom.</p>

		<p>When they had started out on the journey,
		Guimara had said, &#8220;O, D. Joa&otilde;, whatever
		happens, don&#8217;t forget me for one single minute.
		Think of me all the time.&#8221; He had
		promised and he had remembered her every
		instant on the journey. However, when
		they reached his own kingdom, he was so
		happy to see home once more after all his adventures
		that he thought he had never before
		<a class="pagenum" id="page112" title="112"></a>been so happy in all his life. After one has
		been living in Giantland it is very pleasant
		to get home where things are a few sizes
		smaller and a bit more convenient. Then,
		too, it was very pleasant for him to see
		all his friends again. He was so happy at
		being home that, just for one little minute,
		he forgot all about Guimara.</p>

		<p>When D. Joa&otilde; remembered Guimara he
		turned around to look at her. When he saw
		her he could hardly believe his eyes. Instead
		of being a tall, tall giantess with her
		head up in the clouds, she reached just to D.
		Joa&otilde;&#8217;s own shoulder. D. Joa&otilde; was so surprised
		that he had to sit down in a chair and
		be fanned. He couldn&#8217;t say a single word
		for eighteen minutes and a half&#8212;his breath
		had been so completely taken away.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It is a good thing that you happened to
		think of me just as soon as you did,&#8221; remarked
		<a class="pagenum" id="page113" title="113"></a>Guimara. &#8220;I was getting smaller
		and smaller. If you had neglected to think
		of me for another minute I should have
		faded away entirely and you would have
		never known what had become of me.&#8221;</p>

		<p>When Guimara became small she lost her
		power as an enchantress entirely. Her
		lovely eyes were always a trifle sad because
		D. Joa&otilde; had forgotten her that one little
		minute. She never went back to Giantland
		but reigned as queen of D. Joa&otilde;&#8217;s kingdom
		for many years.</p>

 			THE ADVENTURES OF A FISHERMAN&#8217;S SON</h2>

		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Long</span> ago there was a man and
		woman who lived in a little mud
		hut under the palm trees on the
		river bank. They had so many children
		they did not know what to do. The little
		hut was altogether too crowded. The man
		had to work early and late to find food
		enough to feed so many. One day the
		seventh son said to his father, &#8220;O, father, I
		found a little puppy yesterday when I was
		playing on the bank of the river. Please let
		me bring it home to keep. I have always
		wanted one.&#8221;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page118" title="118"></a>The father consented sadly. He did not
		know how to find food for the children, and
		an extra puppy to feed seemed an added
		burden. He went to the river bank to fish
		that day with a heavy heart. He cast his
		net in vain. He did not catch a single fish.
		He cast his net from the other side with no
		better luck. He did not catch even one little
		<em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">piabinha</em>.</p>

		<p>Suddenly he heard a voice which seemed
		to come from the river bed itself, it was so
		deep. This is what it said: &#8220;If you will
		give me whatever new you find in your house
		when you go home I will give you fisherman&#8217;s
		luck. You will catch all the fish you wish.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The man remembered the request which
		his seventh son had made that morning.
		&#8220;The new thing I&#8217;ll find in my house when I
		get home will be that puppy,&#8221; said the man
		to himself. &#8220;This will be a splendid way to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page119" title="119"></a>get rid of the puppy which I did not want to
		keep anyway.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Accordingly the man consented to the request
		which came from the strange voice in
		the depths of the river. &#8220;You must seal
		this covenant with your blood,&#8221; said the
		voice.</p>

		<p>The man cut his finger a tiny bit with
		his sharp knife and squeezed a few drops
		of blood from the wound into the river. &#8220;If
		you break this vow the curse of the river
		giant will be upon you and your children
		for ever and ever,&#8221; said the deep voice
		solemnly.</p>

		<p>The fisherman cast his net where the river
		giant commanded, and immediately it was
		so full of fish that the man could hardly draw
		it out of the water. Three times he drew out
		his net, so full that it was in danger of breaking.
		&#8220;Truly this was a fortunate bit of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page120" title="120"></a>business,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;Here I have fish
		enough to feed my family and all I can sell
		in addition.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As the fisherman approached his house
		with his enormous catch of fish one of the
		children came running to meet him. &#8220;O
		father, guess what we have at our house
		which we did not have when you went
		away,&#8221; said the child.</p>

		<p>&#8220;A new puppy,&#8221; replied her father.</p>

		<p>&#8220;O no, father,&#8221; replied the child. &#8220;You
		have not guessed right at all. It is a new
		baby brother.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The poor fisherman burst into tears.
		&#8220;What shall I do! What shall I do!&#8221; he
		sobbed. &#8220;I dare not break my vow to the
		river giant.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The fisherman&#8217;s wife was heartbroken
		when she heard about the business which her
		husband had transacted with the river giant.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page121" title="121"></a>However she could think of no way to
		escape from keeping the contract which he
		had made. She kissed the tiny babe good-bye
		and gave it her blessing. Then the
		fisherman took it down to the river bank and
		threw it into the river at the exact spot from
		which the deep voice had come.</p>

		<p>There in the depths of the river the river
		giant was waiting to receive the new born
		babe. He took the little one into his palace
		of gold and silver and mother-of-pearl with
		ornaments of diamonds, and there the baby
		received excellent care.</p>

		<p>Time passed and the little boy grew into a
		big boy. At last he was fifteen years old
		and a handsome lad indeed, tall and straight,
		with eyes which were dark and deep like the
		river itself, and hair as dark as the shades
		in the depths of the river. All his life he
		had been surrounded with every luxury, but
		<a class="pagenum" id="page122" title="122"></a>he had never seen a single person. He had
		never seen even the river giant. All he
		knew of him was his deep voice which gave
		orders in the palace.</p>

		<p>One day the voice of the river giant said,
		&#8220;I have to go away on a long journey. I
		will leave with you all the keys to all the
		doors in the palace, but do not meddle with
		anything. If you do you must forfeit your
		life.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Many days passed and the lad did not
		hear the voice of the river giant. He missed
		its sound in the palace. It was very still
		and very lonely. At last at the end of fifteen
		days he took one of the keys which the
		river giant had left and opened the door
		which it fitted. The door led into a room
		in the palace where the boy had never been.
		Inside the room was a huge lion. The lion
		was fat and well nourished, but there was
		<a class="pagenum" id="page123" title="123"></a>nothing for it to eat except hay. The boy
		did not meddle with anything and shut the
		door.</p>

		<p>Another fifteen days passed by, and again
		the lad took one of the keys. He opened
		another door in the palace which he had
		never entered. Inside the room he found
		three horses, one black, one white, and one
		chestnut. There was nothing in the room
		for the horses to eat except meat, but in spite
		of it they were fat and well nourished. The
		boy did not touch anything and when he
		went out he shut the door.</p>

		<p>At the end of another fifteen days all
		alone without even the voice of the river
		giant for company, the lad tried another key
		in another door. This room opened into a
		room full of armour. There were daggers
		and knives and swords and muskets and all
		sorts of armour which the boy had never seen
		<a class="pagenum" id="page124" title="124"></a>and did not know anything about. He was
		very much interested in what he saw, but he
		did not meddle with anything.</p>

		<p>The next day he opened the room again
		where the horses were kept. This time one
		of the horses,&#8212;the black one,&#8212;spoke to him
		and said, &#8220;We like hay to eat very much better
		than this meat which was left to us by
		mistake. The lion must have our hay.
		Please give this meat to the lion and bring us
		back our hay. If you will do this as I ask
		I&#8217;ll serve you for ever and ever.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The boy took the meat to the lion. The
		lion was very much pleased to exchange the
		hay for it. The lad then took the hay to the
		horses. All at once he remembered how he
		had been told not to meddle with anything.
		This had been meddling. The boy burst
		into tears. &#8220;I shall lose my life as the punishment
		for this deed,&#8221; he sobbed.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page125" title="125"></a>The horses listened in amazement. &#8220;I
		got you into this trouble,&#8221; said the black
		horse. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ll get you out. Just trust
		me to find a way out.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The black horse advised the boy to take
		some extra clothes and a sword and musket
		and mount upon his back. &#8220;I have lived
		here in the depths of the river so long that
		my speed is greater than that of the river
		itself,&#8221; said the horse. &#8220;If there was any
		doubt of it before, now that I have had some
		hay once more I am sure I can run faster than
		any river in the world.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It was true. When the river giant came
		back home and found that the boy had meddled
		he ran as fast as he could in pursuit of
		the lad. The black horse safely and surely
		carried the lad beyond his reach.</p>

		<p>The black horse and his rider travelled on
		and on until finally they came to a kingdom
		<a class="pagenum" id="page126" title="126"></a>which was ruled over by a king who had
		three beautiful daughters. The lad at once
		applied for a position in the service of this
		king. &#8220;I do not know what you can do,&#8221;
		said the king. &#8220;You have such soft white
		hands. Perhaps you may serve to carry
		bouquets of flowers from my garden every
		morning to my three daughters.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The lad had eyes which were dark and
		deep like the depths of the river, and when
		he carried bouquets of flowers from the garden
		to the king&#8217;s daughters the youngest
		princess fell in love with him at once. Her
		two sisters laughed at her. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care
		what you say,&#8221; said the youngest princess.
		&#8220;He is far handsomer than any of the princes
		who have ever sung of love beneath our
		balcony.&#8221;</p>

		<p>That very night two princes from neighbouring
		kingdoms came to sing in the palace
		<a class="pagenum" id="page127" title="127"></a>garden beneath the balcony of the three
		princesses. The two oldest daughters of the
		king were proud and haughty, but the youngest
		princess had love in her heart and love in
		her eyes. For this reason she was one whom
		all the princes admired most.</p>

		<p>The lad from the river listened to their
		songs. &#8220;I wish I looked like these two
		princes and knew songs like theirs,&#8221; said he.
		Just then he caught sight of his own reflection
		in the fountain in the garden. He saw
		that he looked quite as well as they. &#8220;I too
		will sing a song before the balcony of the
		princesses,&#8221; he decided.</p>

		<p>He did not know that he could sing, but
		in truth his voice had in it all the music of
		the rushing of the river. When he sang
		even the two rival musicians stopped to listen
		to his song. The two older princesses
		did not know who was singing, but the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page128" title="128"></a>youngest princess recognized him at once.</p>

		<p>The next day a great tournament took
		place. The lad from the river had never
		seen a tournament, but after he had watched
		it for a moment he decided to enter. He
		went to get the black horse which had carried
		him out of the depths of the river and the
		arms he had brought with him from the
		palace of the river giant. With such a horse
		and such arms he carried off all the honours
		of the tournament. Every one at the tournament
		wondered who the strange <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cavalheiro</em>
		could be. No one recognized him except the
		youngest princess. She knew who it was the
		moment she saw him and gave him her ribbon
		to wear.</p>

		<p>The next day all the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cavalheiros</em> who had
		taken part in the tournament set out to slay
		the wild beast which often came out of the
		jungle to attack the city. It was the lad
		<a class="pagenum" id="page129" title="129"></a>from the river who killed the beast, as all the
		<em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cavalheiros</em> knew. When they returned to
		the palace with the news that the beast had
		been slain, the king said, &#8220;Tomorrow night
		we will hold the greatest <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">festa</em> which this
		palace has ever witnessed. Tomorrow let
		all the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cavalheiros</em> who are here assembled
		go forth to hunt for birds to grace our table.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The next day the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cavalheiros</em> went out to
		hunt the birds, and it was the lad from the
		river who succeeded in slaying the birds.
		None of the other <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cavalheiros</em> were at all successful.
		The two neighbouring princes who
		were suitors for the hand of the youngest
		princess made a contract. &#8220;We cannot let
		this stranger carry off all the honours,&#8221; said
		one to the other. &#8220;You say that you killed
		the beast, and I will say that it was I who
		killed the birds.&#8221;</p>

		<p>That night at the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">festa</em> one prince stood
		<a class="pagenum" id="page130" title="130"></a>up before the king and told his story of slaying
		the beast, and the other prince stood up
		and told how he had killed the birds. The
		other <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cavalheiros</em> knew that it was false, but
		when they looked around for the <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cavalheiro</em>
		who had done the valiant deeds they could
		not find him. The lad from the river had
		on his old clothes which he wore as a servant
		in the garden and stood at the lower part of
		the banquet hall among the servants.</p>

		<p>When the king had heard the stories of the
		two princes he was greatly pleased with what
		they had done. &#8220;The one who killed the
		beast shall have a princess for a bride,&#8221; said
		he, &#8220;and the one who killed the birds he too
		shall have a princess for his bride.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The youngest princess saw the lad from
		the river standing among the servants and
		smiled into his eyes. The lad came and
		threw himself before the king. &#8220;O my
		<a class="pagenum" id="page131" title="131"></a>king,&#8221; said he, &#8220;these stories to which you
		have listened are false, as all these assembled
		<em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cavalheiros</em> will prove. It is I who killed
		the beast and all the birds. I claim a princess
		as my bride.&#8221;</p>

		<p>All the assembled <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cavalheiros</em> recognized
		the lad in spite of his changed appearance
		in his gardening clothes. &#8220;<em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Viva!</em>&#8221; they
		shouted. &#8220;He speaks the truth. He is the
		valiant one of us who killed the beast and the
		birds. To him belongs the reward.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The youngest princess had a heart filled
		with joy. The wedding feast was celebrated
		the very next day. The river giant
		found out about it and sent a necklace of
		pearls and diamonds as a wedding gift to the
		bride of the lad whom he had brought up in
		his palace. The fisherman and his wife,
		however, never knew the great good fortune
		which had come to their son.</p>

			THE BEAST SLAYER</h2>

		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Once</span> upon a time there was a man
		and his wife who were very poor.
		The man earned his living making
		wooden bowls and platters to sell and
		worked early and late, but wooden bowls
		and platters were so very cheap that he could
		barely support his family no matter how hard
		he worked. The man and his wife were the
		parents of three lovely daughters. They
		were all exceedingly beautiful, and the man
		and his wife often lamented the fact that
		they did not have money enough to educate
		them and clothe them fittingly.</p>

		<p>One day there came to the door of the poor
		<a class="pagenum" id="page136" title="136"></a>man&#8217;s house a handsome young man mounted
		on a beautiful horse. He asked to buy one
		of the poor man&#8217;s daughters. The father
		was very much shocked at this request. &#8220;I
		may be poor,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I am not so poor
		that I have to sell my children.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The young man, however, threatened to
		kill him if he refused to do his bidding; so
		finally, after a short struggle, the father consented
		to part with his eldest daughter. He
		received a great sum of money in return.</p>

		<p>The father was now a rich man and did
		not wish to make bowls and platters any
		longer. His wife, however, urged him to
		keep on with his former occupation. Accordingly
		he went on with his work. The
		very next day there came to his door another
		young man, even handsomer than the other,
		mounted upon even a finer horse. This
		young man made the same request that the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page137" title="137"></a>other had done. He wanted to buy one of
		the daughters.</p>

		<p>The father burst into tears and told all the
		dreadful happenings of the day before.
		The young man, however, showed no pity
		and continued to demand one of the daughters.
		He made fearful threats if the man
		would not yield to his request, and the father
		became so frightened that he at length parted
		with his second daughter. The first young
		man had paid a great sum of money, but this
		one paid even more.</p>

		<p>Though he was now very rich the father
		still went on making bowls and platters to
		please his wife. The next day when he was
		at work the handsomest young man he had
		ever seen appeared riding upon a most beautiful
		steed. This young man demanded the
		third daughter. The poor father had to
		yield just as before, though it nearly broke
		<a class="pagenum" id="page138" title="138"></a>his heart to part with his only remaining
		child. The price which the young man paid
		was so very great that the family was now as
		rich as it had once been poor.</p>

		<p>Their home was not childless very long,
		for soon a baby son came to them. They
		brought up the boy in great luxury. One
		day when the child was at school he quarrelled
		with one of his playmates. This
		taunt was thrown in his face: &#8220;Ah, ha!
		You think your father was always rich, do
		you? He is a rich man now, it is true, but
		it is because he sold your three sisters.&#8221; The
		words made the boy sad, but he said nothing
		about the matter at home. He hid it away
		in his mind until he had become a man.
		Then he went to his father and mother and
		demanded that they should tell him all
		about it.</p>

		<p>His parents told the young man the whole
		<a class="pagenum" id="page139" title="139"></a>story of the strange experiences through
		which they had obtained their wealth. &#8220;I
		am now a man,&#8221; said the son. &#8220;I feel that
		it is right that I should go out into the world
		in search of my sisters. Perhaps I might be
		able to find them and aid them in some way.
		Give me your blessing and allow me to go.&#8221;</p>

		<p>His father and mother gave him their
		blessing, and the young man started out to
		make a search through all the world. Soon
		he came to a house where there were three
		brothers quarrelling over a boot, a cap, and
		a key. &#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; asked the
		young man. &#8220;Why are these things so
		valuable that you should quarrel over
		them?&#8221;</p>

		<p>The brothers replied that if one said to
		the boot, &#8220;O Boot, put me somewhere,&#8221; the
		boot would immediately put him anywhere
		he wished to go. If one said to the cap, &#8220;O
		<a class="pagenum" id="page140" title="140"></a>Cap, hide me,&#8221; immediately the cap would
		hide him so he could not be seen. The key
		could unlock any door in the whole world.
		The young man at once wanted to own these
		things himself, and he offered so much money
		for them that at last the three brothers decided
		to end their quarrel by selling the boot,
		the cap, and the key and dividing the money.</p>

		<p>The young man put the three treasures in
		his saddle bag and went on his way. As soon
		as he was out of sight of the house he said to
		the boot, &#8220;O Boot, put me in the house of my
		eldest sister.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Immediately the young man found himself
		in the most magnificent palace he had ever
		seen in his life. He asked to speak with his
		sister, but the queen of the palace replied
		that she had no brother and did not wish to
		be bothered with the stranger. It took much
		urging for the young man to gain permission
		<a class="pagenum" id="page141" title="141"></a>from her to relate his story; but, when she
		had once heard it, everything sounded so
		logical that she decided to receive him as her
		brother. She asked how he had ever found
		her home, and how he had come through the
		thicket which surrounded her palace. The
		young man told her about his magic boot.</p>

		<p>In the afternoon the queen suddenly burst
		into tears. Her brother asked what the
		trouble was. &#8220;O dear! O dear! What
		shall we do! What shall we do!&#8221; sobbed
		the queen. &#8220;My husband is King of the
		Fishes. When he comes home to dinner tonight
		he will be very angry to find a human
		in his palace.&#8221; The young man told her
		about his magic cap and comforted her fears.</p>

		<p>Soon the King of Fishes arrived, accompanied
		by all his retinue. He came into the
		palace in a very bad temper, giving kicks
		and blows to everything which came in his
		<a class="pagenum" id="page142" title="142"></a>way, and saying in a fierce, savage voice,
		&#8220;<i>Lee, low, lee, leer</i>, I smell the blood of a
		human, here. I smell the blood of a human,
		here.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It took much persuasion on the part of the
		queen to get him to take a bath. After his
		bath he appeared in the form of a handsome
		man. He then ate his dinner, and when he
		had nearly finished the meal his wife said to
		him, &#8220;If you should see my brother here what
		would you do to him?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I would be kind to him, of course, just as
		I am to you,&#8221; responded the King of the
		Fishes. &#8220;If he is here let him appear.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The young man then took off the magic
		cap by which he had hidden himself. The
		king treated him most kindly and courteously.
		He invited him to live for the rest
		of his life in the palace. The young man
		declined the invitation, saying that he had
		<a class="pagenum" id="page143" title="143"></a>two other sisters to visit. He took his departure
		soon, and when he went away his
		brother-in-law gave him a scale with these
		words: &#8220;If you are ever in any danger in
		which I can help you, take this scale and say,
		&#8216;Help me, O King of the Fishes.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

		<p>The young man put the scale in his saddle
		bag. Then he took out his magic boot and
		said, &#8220;O Boot, put me in the home of my second
		sister.&#8221; He found his second sister
		queen of even a more wonderful palace than
		his eldest sister. Her husband was King of
		Rams and treated the newly found brother of
		his queen with great consideration. When
		the young man had finished his visit there
		the King of Rams gave him a piece of wool
		saying, &#8220;If you are ever in any peril in which
		I can help you pull this wool and ask help
		of the King of Rams.&#8221;</p>

		<p>With the aid of his magic boot the young
		<a class="pagenum" id="page144" title="144"></a>man went to visit the home of his youngest
		sister. He found her in the most magnificent
		palace of them all. Her husband was
		King of Pigeons. When the young man departed
		he gave him a feather telling him if
		he was ever in any danger that all he had to
		do was to pull the feather and say, &#8220;Help
		me, O King of the Pigeons.&#8221;</p>

		<p>All three of the young man&#8217;s brothers-in-law
		had admired the power of his magic boot
		and they had all advised him to visit the land
		of the King of Giants by means of it. After
		having left each of his three sisters full of
		happiness in her costly palace he felt free to
		act upon this advice, so by means of his magic
		boot he again found himself in a new
		country.</p>

		<p>He soon heard on the street that the King
		of the land of Giants had a beautiful
		giantess daughter whom he wished to give
		<a class="pagenum" id="page145" title="145"></a>in marriage if she could be persuaded to
		choose a husband. She was such a famous
		beauty that no one could pass before her
		palace without eagerly gazing up in hopes of
		seeing her lovely face at the window. The
		giant princess had grown weary of being the
		object of so much attention, and she had
		made a vow that she would marry no one except
		a man who could pass before her without
		lifting his eyes.</p>

		<p>The young man became interested when
		he heard this and at once rode past the palace
		with his eyes fixed steadily on the ground.
		He did not give a single glance upward in
		the direction of the window where the beautiful
		giant princess was watching him. The
		princess was overcome with joy at the sight
		of the handsome stranger who appeared as
		if in response to her vow. The king summoned
		him to the palace at once and ordered
		<a class="pagenum" id="page146" title="146"></a>that the wedding should be celebrated immediately.</p>

		<p>After the wedding the giant princess soon
		found out that her husband carried his choicest
		treasures in his saddle bags. She inquired
		their significance and her husband
		told her all about them. She was especially
		interested in the key. She said that there
		was a room in the palace which was never
		opened. In this room there was a fierce
		beast which always came to life again whenever
		it was killed. The giant princess had
		always been anxious to see the beast with her
		own eyes, and she suggested that they should
		use the key to unlock the door of the forbidden
		room and take a peep at the beast.</p>

		<p>Her husband, however, gave her no encouragement
		to do this. He decided that it
		was too risky a bit of amusement; but one
		day when he had gone hunting with the king
		<a class="pagenum" id="page147" title="147"></a>and court the princess was overjoyed to find
		that the magic key had been left behind.
		She at once picked it up and opened the forbidden
		door. The beast gave a great leap,
		roaring out at her, &#8220;You are the very one I
		have sought,&#8221; as he seized her with his sharp
		claws.</p>

		<p>When her husband and father returned
		from their hunting trip they were very much
		worried to find that the princess had disappeared.
		No one knew where she was.
		After searching through the palace and garden
		all in vain they went to the place where
		the beast was always kept. The prince
		recognized his magic key in the door, but the
		room was empty. The beast had fled with
		the giant princess.</p>

		<p>Once more the young man made use of his
		magic boot and soon was by the side of the
		princess. The beast had hidden her in a
		<a class="pagenum" id="page148" title="148"></a>cave by the sea and had gone away in search
		of food. The giant princess was delighted
		to find her husband whom she had never expected
		to see again and wanted to hasten
		away from the cave with him at once.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You have got yourself into this affair,&#8221;
		said her husband. &#8220;I can get you out again,
		I think, but I believe that it is your duty to
		at least make an effort to take the beast&#8217;s
		life. Perhaps when he comes back to the
		cave you can extract from him the secret of
		his charmed life.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The princess awaited the return of the
		beast. Then she asked him to tell her the
		secret of his charmed life. The beast was
		very much flattered to have the giant princess
		so interested in him, and he told it to
		her at once. He never thought of a plot.
		This is what he said: &#8220;My life is in the sea.
		In the sea there is a chest. In the chest there
		<a class="pagenum" id="page149" title="149"></a>is a stone. In the stone there is a pigeon.
		In the pigeon there is an egg. In the egg
		there is a candle. At the moment when that
		candle is extinguished I die.&#8221;</p>

		<p>All this time the prince had remained
		there, hiding under his magic cap. He
		heard every word the beast said. As soon
		as the beast had gone to sleep the prince stood
		on the seashore and said: &#8220;Help me, O
		King of the Fishes,&#8221; as he took out the scale
		which his brother-in-law had given him.
		Immediately there appeared a great multitude
		of fishes asking what he wished them to
		do. He asked them to get the chest from the
		depths of the sea. They replied that they
		had never seen such a chest, but that probably
		the sword-fish would know about it.</p>

		<p>They hastened to call the sword-fish and
		he came at once. He said that he had
		seen the chest only a moment before. All
		<a class="pagenum" id="page150" title="150"></a>the fishes went with him to get it, and they
		soon brought the chest out of the sea. The
		prince opened the chest easily with the aid
		of his magic key, and inside he found a stone.</p>

		<p>Then the prince pulled the piece of wool
		which his second brother-in-law had given
		him and said, &#8220;Help me, O King of the
		Rams.&#8221; Immediately there appeared a
		great drove of rams, running to the seashore
		from all directions. They attacked the
		stone, giving it mighty blows with their hard
		heads and horns. Soon they broke open the
		stone, and from out of it there flew a pigeon.</p>

		<p>The beast now awoke from his sleep and
		knew that he was very ill. He remembered
		all that he had told the princess and accused
		her of having made a plot against his life.
		He seized his great ax to kill the princess.</p>

		<p>In the meantime the prince had pulled the
		feather which his third brother-in-law had
		<a class="pagenum" id="page151" title="151"></a>given him and cried, &#8220;Help me, O King of
		the Pigeons.&#8221; Immediately a great flock of
		pigeons appeared attacking the pigeon and
		tearing it to pieces.</p>

		<div id="pigeons" class="image">
			<a href="images/pigeons.jpg"><img src="images/pigeons.thumb.jpg" width="311" height="445" title="Immediately a great flock of pigeons appeared" alt="A young man by the sea holds a feather; many birds are in the distance." /></a>
		</div>

		<p>Just as the beast had caught the princess
		and was about to slay her, the prince took the
		egg from within the slain pigeon. He at
		once broke the egg and blew out the candle.
		At that moment the beast fell dead, and the
		princess escaped unharmed.</p>

		<p>The prince carried the giant princess
		home to her father&#8217;s kingdom and the king
		made a great <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">festa</em> which lasted many days.
		There was rejoicing throughout the whole
		kingdom because of the death of the beast
		and because of the safety of the lovely princess.
		The prince was praised throughout
		the kingdom and there is talk of him even
		unto this very day.</p>

		<p>The prince had cut off the head of the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page152" title="152"></a>great beast and the tip of its tail. The head
		he had given to the king, but the tip of the
		tail he kept for himself. The beast was so
		enormous that just the tip of its tail made a
		great ring large enough to encircle the
		prince&#8217;s body. One day, just in fun, he
		twined the tip of the beast&#8217;s tail around his
		waist. He immediately grew and grew until
		he became a giant himself, almost as tall
		as the king of the land of giants, and several
		leagues taller than the princess. It is not
		strange that a man who became a giant
		among giants should be famous even until
		now.</p>

			THE QUEST OF CLEVERNESS</h2>

		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Once</span> long ago there lived a king
		who had a stupid son. His father
		sent him to school for many years
		hoping that he might learn something there.
		His teachers all gave him up as hopelessly
		stupid, and with one accord they said, &#8220;It is
		no use trying to teach this lad out of books.
		It is just a waste of our valuable time.&#8221;</p>

		<p>At length the king called together all the
		wisest men of his kingdom to consult with
		them as to the best way to make the prince
		wise and clever. They talked the matter
		over for a year and a day. It was the unanimous
		opinion of the wise men of the kingdom
		<a class="pagenum" id="page156" title="156"></a>that the lad should be sent on a journey
		through many lands. In this way he might
		learn many of the things which his teachers
		had not been able to teach him out of books.</p>

		<p>Accordingly the prince was equipped for
		his journey. He was given fine raiment, a
		splendid black horse upon which to ride, and
		a great bag full of money. Thus prepared,
		he started forth from the palace one bright
		morning with the blessing of the king, his
		father, and of all the wise men of the kingdom.</p>

		<p>The prince journeyed through many lands.
		In one country he learned one thing, and in
		another country he learned another thing.
		There was no country or kingdom so small
		or poor that it did not have something to
		teach the prince. And the prince, though he
		had been so insufferably stupid at his books,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page157" title="157"></a>learned the lessons of his journey with an
		open mind.</p>

		<p>After long wanderings the prince arrived
		at a city where there was an auction going
		on. A singing bird was being offered for
		sale. &#8220;What is the special advantage of
		this singing bird?&#8221; asked the prince.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This bird, at the command of its owner,
		will sing a song which will put to sleep any
		one who listens to it,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

		<p>The prince decided that the bird was worth
		purchasing.</p>

		<p>The next thing which was offered for sale
		was a beetle. &#8220;What is the special advantage
		of this beetle?&#8221; asked the prince.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This beetle will gnaw its way through
		any wall in the world,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

		<p>The prince purchased the beetle.</p>

		<p>Then a butterfly was offered for sale.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page158" title="158"></a>&#8220;What is the special advantage of owning
		this butterfly?&#8221; asked the prince.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This butterfly is strong enough to bear
		upon its wings any weight which is put upon
		them,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

		<p>The prince bought the butterfly. With
		his bird and beetle and butterfly he travelled
		on and on until he became lost in the jungle.
		The foliage was so dense that he could not
		see his way, so he climbed to the top of the
		tallest tree he saw. From its summit he
		spied in the distance what looked like a
		mountain; but, when he had journeyed near
		to it, he saw that it was really the wall which
		surrounds the land of the giants.</p>

		<p>A great giant whose head reached to the
		clouds stood on the wall as guard. A song
		from the singing bird put this guard to sleep
		immediately. The beetle soon had gnawed
		an entrance through the wall. Through
		<a class="pagenum" id="page159" title="159"></a>this opening the prince entered the land of
		the giants.</p>

		<p>The very first person whom the prince saw
		in the land of the giants was a lovely captive
		princess. The opening which the beetle had
		made in the wall led directly to the dungeon
		in which she was confined.</p>

		<p>The prince had learned many things on
		his journey, and among the lessons he had
		learned was this one: &#8220;Always rescue a fair
		maiden in distress.&#8221; He immediately asked
		what he could do to rescue the beautiful captive
		princess.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You can never succeed in rescuing me, I
		fear,&#8221; replied the princess. &#8220;At the door of
		this palace there is a giant on guard who
		never sleeps.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; replied the prince. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
		put him to sleep.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Just at that moment the giant himself
		<a class="pagenum" id="page160" title="160"></a>strode into the dungeon. He had heard
		voices there. &#8220;Sing, my little bird, sing,&#8221;
		commanded the prince to his singing bird.</p>

		<p>At the first burst of melody the giant went
		to sleep there in the dungeon, though he had
		never before taken a wink of sleep in all his
		life.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This beetle of mine has gnawed an entrance
		through the great wall which surrounds
		the land of the giants,&#8221; said the
		prince to the captive princess. &#8220;To escape
		we&#8217;ll not have to climb the high wall.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;What of the guard who stands on top of
		the wall with his head reaching up to the
		clouds?&#8221; asked the princess. &#8220;Will he not
		spy us?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;My singing bird has put him to sleep,
		too,&#8221; replied the prince. &#8220;If we hurry out
		he will not yet be awake.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I have been confined here in this dungeon
		<a class="pagenum" id="page161" title="161"></a>so long that I fear I have forgotten how to
		walk,&#8221; said the princess.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; replied the prince. &#8220;My
		butterfly will bear you upon his wings.&#8221;</p>

		<p>With the lovely princess borne safely
		upon the butterfly&#8217;s wings the prince swiftly
		escaped from the land of the giants. The
		giant on the wall yawned in his sleep as
		they looked up at him. &#8220;He is good for
		another hour&#8217;s nap,&#8221; remarked the prince.</p>

		<div id="butterfly" class="image">
			<a href="images/butterfly.jpg"><img src="images/butterfly.thumb.jpg" width="312" height="443" title="With the lovely princess borne safely upon the butterfly's wings, the prince swiftly escaped" alt="A young man carries a cage and leads a butterfly which is carrying a young woman." /></a>
		</div>

		<p>The prince returned to his father&#8217;s kingdom
		as soon as he could find the way back.
		He took with him the lovely princess, and
		the singing bird, and the gnawing beetle,
		and the strong-winged butterfly.</p>

		<p>His father and all the people of the kingdom
		received him with great joy. &#8220;Never
		again will the prince of our kingdom be
		called stupid,&#8221; said the wise men when they
		heard the account of his adventures. &#8220;With
		<a class="pagenum" id="page162" title="162"></a>his singing bird and his gnawing beetle and
		his strong-winged butterfly he has become
		the cleverest youth in the land.&#8221;</p>

			THE GIANT&#8217;S PUPIL</h2>

		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Long</span> years ago there lived a little
		boy whose name was Manoel. His
		father and mother were so very poor
		that they could not afford to send him to
		school. Because he did not go to school he
		played all day in the fields on the edge of
		the forest where the giant lived.</p>

		<p>One day Manoel met the giant. The
		giant lived all alone in the forest, so he was
		very lonely and wished he had a little boy
		like Manoel. He loved little Manoel as
		soon as he saw him, and after that they were
		together every day. The giant taught
		Manoel all the secrets of the forests and
		jungles. He taught him all the secrets of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page166" title="166"></a>the wind and the rain and the thunder and
		the lightning. He taught him all the secrets
		of the beasts and the birds and the serpents.</p>

		<p>Manoel grew up a wise lad indeed. His
		father and mother were very proud of him
		and so was his kind teacher, the giant.</p>

		<p>One day the king&#8217;s messenger rode up and
		down the kingdom with a message from the
		king&#8217;s daughter. The king&#8217;s daughter, the
		beautiful princess of the land, had promised
		to wed the man who could tell her a riddle
		she could not guess. All the princes who
		had sung of love beneath the palace window
		had been very stupid. The princess wished
		to marry a man who knew more than she did.</p>

		<p>When Manoel heard the words of the messenger
		he said to his father and mother, &#8220;I
		am going to the palace to tell a riddle to the
		princess. I am sure I can give her one which
		she cannot guess.&#8221;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page167" title="167"></a>&#8220;You are an exceedingly clever lad, I
		know, my son,&#8221; replied his mother, &#8220;but
		there will be many princes and handsome
		<em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cavalheiros</em> at the palace to tell riddles to
		the princess. What if she will not listen to
		a lad in shabby clothing!&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I will make the princess listen to my
		riddle,&#8221; replied Manoel.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What riddle are you going to ask the
		princess?&#8221; asked Manoel&#8217;s father.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I do not know yet,&#8221; replied the lad. &#8220;I
		will make up a riddle on the way to the
		palace. I am going to start at once.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The kind giant who had been the lad&#8217;s
		friend gave him his blessing and wished him
		luck. The lad&#8217;s mother prepared a lunch
		for him to carry with him. His father sat
		before the door and boasted to all the neighbours
		that his son was going to wed the
		king&#8217;s daughter. Manoel took his dog with
		<a class="pagenum" id="page168" title="168"></a>him when he went on his journey, because he
		wanted some one for company.</p>

		<p>Manoel journeyed on and on through the
		forests and jungles and after a time he had
		eaten all the lunch his mother had given him
		when he went from home. When he became
		hungry he spent his last <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">vintem</em> for some
		bread from a little <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">venda</em> in the town he
		passed through. He went on to the forest
		to eat the bread, and before he tasted of it
		himself he gave a piece to his dog. The dog
		died immediately. The bread was poisoned.</p>

		<p>Even as Manoel stood by weeping for his
		faithful dog, three big black buzzards flew
		down and devoured the dead beast. They
		fell dead immediately. Just then the lad
		heard voices, and soon he saw seven horsemen
		approaching. The men were robbers,
		and though they had much gold in their pockets
		they had no food. &#8220;I am hungry enough
		<a class="pagenum" id="page169" title="169"></a>to eat a dead buzzard,&#8221; said the captain of
		the robbers. The robbers greedily seized the
		three buzzards and devoured them at once.
		The seven men immediately died from the
		poison.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The buzzards stole the body of my dog, so
		they became mine,&#8221; said Manoel. &#8220;The
		seven robbers stole my three buzzards, so
		they became mine, too.&#8221; He took all the
		gold from the pockets of the seven robbers
		and dressed himself in the garments of the
		captain of the robbers because they were finest.
		He mounted the horse of the captain of
		the robbers because that was the best horse.</p>

		<p>The lad rode on toward the palace of the
		king. After a time he became thirsty and
		pushed the horse into a gallop. The horse
		became covered with sweat, and with the
		horse&#8217;s sweat he quenched his thirst. Soon
		he arrived at the royal palace.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page170" title="170"></a>Dressed in the robber&#8217;s fine garments and
		mounted upon the robber&#8217;s fine horse,
		Manoel had no difficulty in being admitted
		to the palace. He was taken at once before
		the princess to tell his riddle.</p>

		<p>The princess saw in Manoel&#8217;s eyes all the
		secrets of the forests and jungles which the
		kind giant had taught him. &#8220;Here is a
		youth who will tell me a riddle which will be
		worth listening to,&#8221; said the princess to herself.
		All the princes and <em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cavalheiros</em> from
		all the neighbouring kingdoms had told her
		such stupid riddles that she had been bored
		nearly to death. She could always guess
		the answers, even before she had heard the
		end of the riddle.</p>

		<p>This is the riddle which Manoel told the
		princess:</p>


		<div class="poem">
			<p>&#8220;I went away from home with a pocket full;</p>
			<p>Soon it became empty;</p>
			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page171" title="171"></a>Again it became full.</p>
			<p>I went away from home with a companion;</p>
			<p>My pocket-full killed my companion;</p>
			<p>My dead companion was the slayer of three;</p>
			<p>The three killed seven.</p>
			<p>From the seven I chose the best;</p>
			<p>I drank water which did not fall from heaven.</p>
			<p>And here I stand</p>
			<p>Before the loveliest princess in the land.&#8221;</p>
		</div>

		<p>The princess listened to the riddle carefully.
		Then she asked Manoel to say it all
		over again. The princess thought and
		thought, but she did not have a good guess
		as to the answer to the riddle.</p>

		<p>No one in all the palace could understand
		Manoel&#8217;s riddle. &#8220;You have won my
		daughter as your bride,&#8221; said the king, after
		he had used all his royal wits to solve the
		riddle and could not do it.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page172" title="172"></a>When Manoel explained his riddle to the
		princess, she said, &#8220;<em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Nossa Senhora</em> herself
		must have sent you to me. I never could
		have endured a stupid husband.&#8221;</p>

			DOMINGO&#8217;S CAT</h2>

		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Once</span> upon a time there was a man
		who was very poor. He was so
		poor that he had to sell one thing
		after another to get food to keep from
		starving. After a while there was nothing
		left except the cat. He was very fond of
		his cat, and he said, &#8220;O, Cat, let come what
		will, I&#8217;ll never part with you. I would
		rather starve.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The cat replied, &#8220;O good master Domingo,
		rest in peace. You will never
		starve as long as you have me. I am going
		out into the world to make a fortune for us
		both.&#8221;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page176" title="176"></a>The cat went out into the jungle and dug
		and dug. Every time he dug he turned up
		silver pieces. The cat took a number of
		these home to his master so that he could
		purchase food. The rest of the pieces of
		silver the cat carried to the king.</p>

		<p>The next day the cat dug up pieces of
		gold and carried them to the king. The
		next day he carried pieces of diamonds.</p>

		<div id="coins" class="image">

		</div>

		<p>&#8220;Where do you get these rich gifts? Who
		is sending me such wonderful presents?&#8221;
		asked the king.</p>

		<p>The cat replied, &#8220;It is my master, Domingo.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Now the king had a beautiful daughter.
		He thought that this man Domingo must be
		the richest man in the whole kingdom. He
		decided that his daughter should marry him
		at once. He made arrangements for the
		wedding through the cat.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page177" title="177"></a>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any clothes to wear at the wedding,&#8221;
		said Domingo when the cat told him
		that he was to marry the daughter of the
		king.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Never mind about that. Just leave it
		to me,&#8221; replied the cat.</p>

		<p>The cat went to the king and said, &#8220;O
		King, there has been a terrible fire in the
		tailor shop where they were making the
		wedding garments of my master, Domingo.
		The tailor and all of his assistants were
		burned to death, and the entire outfit of my
		master Domingo was destroyed. Hasn&#8217;t
		your majesty something which you could
		lend him to wear at the wedding?&#8221; The
		king sent the richest garments which his
		wardrobe afforded. Domingo was clothed
		in state ready for the wedding.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I have no palace to which to take my
		bride,&#8221; said Domingo to the cat.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page178" title="178"></a>&#8220;Never mind. I&#8217;ll see about it at once,&#8221;
		replied the cat.</p>

		<p>The cat went into the forest to the great
		castle where the giant dwelt. He marched
		straight up to the big giant and said, &#8220;O
		Giant, I wish to borrow your castle for my
		master Domingo. Will you not be so kind
		as to lend it to me a little while?&#8221;</p>

		<p>The giant was very much insulted. &#8220;No,
		indeed, I&#8217;ll not lend my castle to you or
		your master Domingo or anybody else,&#8221; he
		shouted in his most terrible voice.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; replied the cat. He
		changed the giant to a piece of bacon in the
		twinkling of an eye and devoured him on
		the spot.</p>

		<p>The palace of the giant was a very wonderful
		palace. There was one room decked
		with silver, and one room decked with gold,
		and one room decked with diamonds. A
		<a class="pagenum" id="page179" title="179"></a>beautiful river flowed by the garden gate.</p>

		<p>As Domingo and his bride sailed down the
		river to the garden gate in the royal barge,
		they saw the cat sitting in the window singing.
		After that they never saw him again.
		He disappeared in the jungle and went to
		make some other poor man rich. Perhaps
		he will come your way some day. Who
		knows? &#8220;<em xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Quem sabe?</em>&#8221; they say in Brazil.</p>
